"aarakocra","A powerful aarakocra warrior fromChult. Aarakocra resembled humanoid birds. The average specimen stood about 5 feet  (1.5 meters) tall and had a wingspan of 20 feet  (6.1 meters). Halfway along the edge of each wing was a hand with three human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. An elongated fourth finger extended the length of the wing and locked in place during flight. The hands could not grasp while flying, but they were nearly as useful ashumanhands when an aarakocra was perched and its wings were folded back.[3][note 1] Their powerful legs ended in four sharp talons that could unlock and fold back to reveal another pair of functional hands. These humanoids had hollow, fragile bones. Their faces combined the features of bothparrotsandeagles. They had gray-black beaks and black eyes. Plumage color varied, but males generally had red, orange, and yellow coloration, while females tended towards brown and gray.[3]"
"aboleth","Aboleths were fish-like amphibians of immense size, often reaching 20 feet  (6.1 meters) in length and weighing up to 6,500 pounds  (2,900 kilograms),[10][9]though they continued to grow as they aged and some fantastically ancient specimens might reach 40 feet  (12 meters) in length.[11]They resembled a bizarre eel, with long, tubular bodies, as well as a tail at one end and two fins near the head and another along the back. Aboleths' mouths werelamprey-like, filled with serrated, jawless teeth.[9] Aboleth underbellies were often orange-pink, while their topsides were typically sea-green. A little bit back from the head were four long tentacles, two sprouting from across each other on the top, and two more of the same on the underbelly. Their heads were roughly triangular-shaped, with a spherical, somewhat beak-like nose. Above the nose were their three eyes, each one set atop the other. Tendrils and a few shorter tentacles dangled from the bottom of the head. Four blue-black slime-secreting orifices lined the bottom of their bodies.[9]Aboleth blood was green and thick, oozing like sap.[12] Aboleths breathed through a thick gray mucus-like substance, which covered their body and which they exuded from four pulsating organs along their body as they moved.[10]If robbed of the ability to exude this slime, an aboleth would suffocate in water or on land alike. As such, an aboleth had to take care of its mucus. Out of the water, an aboleth's membrane-like skin dried out quickly, but this did not prove fatal in and of itself. Instead, the aboleth would eventually enter a state of suspended animation, called long dreaming, a fate considered far worse than simply dying amongst aboleths. During this process, the so-hampered aboleth formed a tough, waterproof membrane. However, if this membrane was pierced, liquid flooded out and death was usually not far off for the aboleth.[13] Aboleths did not die of old age and so lived on indefinitely, barring violence or disease.[13]"
"aldani","An aldani resembled alobster, but was the size of ahumanbeing. They walked upright on twohumanoidlegs,[1][3]but swam like lobsters.[3]Their faces vaguely resembled that of a human, though encased in chitinous armor and their eyes extend upon long stalks.[1][3]"
"allip","Allips were spectral variations of the persons they once were, with nightmarish, warped features befitting of the madness that possessed them. Their lower portions trailed away into a dark, faint fog as they floated.[3]"
"almiraj","Almiraj resembled a large rabbit[1]orharewith yellowish fur which is soft, and a 1‑foot-long (30‑centimeter) spiraled horn, usually black in color,[4]in their foreheads, likeunicorns.[1]"
"ambush drake","Ambush drakes grew to be 5 feet  (1.5 meters) in length and 200 pounds  (91 kilograms) in weight, with their bodies covered in scales of a dark gray or black hue.[3]The leaders of their packs were typically larger in size and bore many scars.[2] These creatures had elongated jaws and muscular builds, though their wings were quite stunted for their size. These wings were only used when necessary, the ambush drake instead preferring to get around on its four legs. When attempting to fly, their glides typically could only cover up to 30 feet  (9.1 meters).[3]"
"deva","Devas appeared ashuman-like men and women[note 2]of extraordinary beauty or handsomeness with two magnificent feathered wings emerging from their shoulders.[6][7][5][3][4][2]Monadic and movanic devas stood around 6–6.5  feet (1.8–1.98  meters) tall, while astral devas were around 7–7.5 feet (2.1–2.3 meters) tall. Their coloration varied: astral devas were golden-hued with fair hair and amber eyes; monadic devas were dark-skinned with black hair and green eyes; and movanic devas were milky-white-skinned with silvery hair and eyes.[6][7][5][3][4]In the late 15thcenturyDR, devas were known for their silvery skin and their lustrous eyes and hair.[2][note 3] Devas were averse to clothing; when they must adhere to mortal custom, they donned simple loincloths or other coverings.[4] When a deva died, all parts of their body, what clothes they wore, their weapons, and their other possessions vanished completely, and thus none were ever examined closely.[5][4]"
"planetar","A planetar usually appeared as a handsome, powerful, and muscularhumanoidcreature[3][6][7]with opalescent[2][6][7]emerald skin.[4][5][2][3]They had opalescent[6][7]white-feathered wings,[4][5][2][3]stood between about 8[4][5]and 9 feet[3](2.4 to 2.7 meters) tall, and weighed about 500 pounds (230 kilograms).[3]They were typically bald.[4][5][3][6][7] Not all planetars appeared like this, however. For example, theShards, the planetars in service toSelûnehad long, flowing blue hair and pearly white skin.[12][13][14][15]"
"solar","A solar had a deep, commanding voice.[3][4][5][6][7]Itshuman-like[4][5]body was muscular[3][4][5]and beautiful,[4][5]with skin of copper,[6][7]silver,[3]gold,[3]or other metallic coloration.[4][5]Its hair was bronze or metallic-colored as well.[4][5][6][7]Its large, gleaming double[6][7]wings were white[3][16]or coppery-gold,[6][7]and its eyes were as radiant topaz.[3][4][5][6][7]Solars stood about 9 feet  (270 centimeters)[3][4][5]or 10 feet  (300 centimeters)[6][7]tall and weighed about 500 pounds  (230 kilograms).[3] Not all solars appeared like this, however. For example, the solars in Corellon's court appeared rather as androgynous elves in shining white robes.[17]"
"flying sword","Despite the name commonly used to refer to them, they could be found in the form of almost any armament such asaxes,maces, self-loadingcrossbows,[1]or evengauntletsofarmor.[2]"
"rug of smothering","There was a large variety of shapes and appearances that a rug of smothering could be made into. They sometimes were built to resemblecarpets of flying, but were otherwise indistinguishable from ordinary, non-magical rugs, except if inspected through magical detection.[1]"
"ankheg","Ankhegs were covered in a strong chitin armor.[1]"
"assassin vine","A single specimen usually consisted of a 20 feet  (6.1 meters) main branch as thick as ahuman's forearm. Smaller vines up to 5 feet  (1.5 meters) extended from the main branch and bore clusters ofgrape-like berries. The bark was stringy. The leaves of an assassin vine were distinct in their asymmetric five-pointed shapes, which resembled a hand.[2] The plants were tougher than usual and were resistant to burning or freezing. Electricity did not harm them at all.[2] Assassin vines could move along the ground but very slowly.[2]"
"astral dreadnought","Astral dreadnoughts were massive creatures. They had a single, large eye above a large mouth filled with sharp teeth. Instead of hands, they had crab-like pincers, which were incredibly strong and lined with sharp, serrated edges. Their entire body was protected by a layer of strong, spiked armor plates, and their lower half of their body was serpentine. Legend had it that their lower half was infinite, stretching off into the distance.[3][4]"
"atropal","Most atropals' appeared as malformed bloated, grotesque and unfinished obviously undead creatures with splotches of black afterbirth. Their skin was wet, wrinkled, and dead, while the head was enlarged and hairless. The creatures' black eyes stared with vacantness as the entire undead body drooled, oozed, and secreted pungent ichor. Their skinny appendages had tiny clawed hands while the legs were useless and atrophied. Unable to walk on the dead misshapen members, atropals always flew.[3][7] Some atropals resembledghoulsto an extent, with pale red skin, long tongues, and razor-sharp teeth. Most of the flesh of an atropal was rotted, with swollen joints and exposed bones. Unlike ghouls, however, atropals lacked eyes, having instead empty, skin-covered sockets.[2]"
"balhannoth","Balhannoths had an ovoid body, six tentacles, and a large mouth of jagged teeth.[3]"
"banderhobb","Banderhobbs were humongous creatures that superficially resembled giant bipedaltoads. Scrawny sets of limbs ending in long keen claws strangely contrasted with their otherwiseogre-sized frames.[1]Within the depths of their massive maws was a serpentine tongue along with two rows of saw-like fangs. Atop their amphibian-like heads was a pair of huge, bulbous eyes that appeared blank and empty.[3] Some banderhobbs lacked the immense size of their kin, being lithe and short where others were stout and tall. Their feet were normally flapping and flat, as they silently moved through the darkness. Other reported traits of the banderhobbs were inconsistent and variable, although it was fully possible that all of them were true.[3] Some banderhobbs were rumored to have extra-dimensional caverns within their stomachs. Reports of those who had been swallowed, stated they were taken to a strange room much larger than the creature. Within the depths of the stomach was a giant face, taking up about half the surface area of the room, with a hole in the middle leading to the true stomach. The ghastly outline was not a true face as it lacked eyes and was distorted, elongated, and a ghastly-white that contrasted with the rest of their flesh-colored insides.[3] After being swallowed by a banderhobb, it was possible to carve a path out of them from the inside, but it had to be done quickly before digestion was completed.[3]"
"banshee","A banshee didn't have a defined shape, but rather a misty form with vague and flowing features that mirrored her former form in life. As time wore on, a banshee became more and more distorted, though was still recognizable as a humanoid.[8]"
"barghest","The true form of the barghests resembledgoblin–wolfhybrids with monstrous jaws and razor sharp claws.[3]They were able to shapeshift into either a goblin or canine form, each of which were indistinguishable from normal members of their kind to most.[5]Goblins immediately recognized barghests in their goblin forms and no matter the canine form they assumed, whetherwar dog,wild dogor wolf, other canines could easily identify them.[4]A hateful, orange glow was given off by their intelligent eyes when they were excited and they occasionally possessed unusual traits that betrayed their true nature, such as a shock of white hair or a discolored eye.[2][3] Barghest whelps naturally appeared as larger, yellow-skinned goblins, eventually developing the ability to take on the form of a large wolf with powerful claws, their true form as this stage. As barghests matured, their forms grew to about 6 feet  (1.8 meters) long, weighed 180 pounds  (82 kilograms), and their yellow skin darkened to a shade of bluish-red until eventually turning entirely blue.[1][3][4]Barghests that achieved greater status could transform into 8 feet  (2.4 meters) tall, 400 pounds  (180 kilograms), goblin-like monsters or intodire wolves.[3]On incredibly rare occasions, barghests could grow to such gargantuan proportions that they could occupy small mountains.[9]Other goblinoid races like thebugbearsorhobgoblinswere known to have barghest versions of their kind.[2]"
"basilisk","Basilisks had eight legs, which they crawled upon. Basilisks came in a variety of colors from dark gray[2]to dark orange, although they also commonly had a dull brown body with a yellowish underbelly.[3]Basilisks possessed a single row of bony spines that lined their backs and a few had a curved horn atop their noses.[3]Basilisk eyes were, however, the most notable feature, glowing with a pale green light. Adult basilisks could grow to be about 6 feet  (1.8 meters) in length, not counting the tail, which could reach another 5​ to ​7 feet (1.5​ to ​2.1 meters). They typically weighed around 300 pounds  (140 kilograms).[3] TheBedinecalled basiliskshagar motabor ""bringers of stone-death"".[9]"
"behir","A behir was often mistaken for a winglessblue dragon.[6]It had a long, snake-like body and could slither on the ground like a snake, but it also had six pairs of legs upon which it could walk or climb if it chose to do so.[3][4]Each of a behir's twelve feet contained three clawed toes.[6]They began life with six or eight legs and grew additional legs as they aged. They grew about 8 feet  (2.4 meters) per year.[4] Behirs had thick, armored scales, much like a dragon. Their scales were colored in variations of dark blue and were lighter on the behir's undersides.[3][4] They had long narrow heads,[6]crocodilianin shape,[4]with curved, black horns on the top[6][3]that were used for preening.[3][4]Behirs hatched lacking horns.[8]Their mouths were full of many sharp multi-colored translucent teeth that were valued for theirgem-like beauty,[6][9]and their bones were crystalline.[10] Newly hatched behirs were about 2 feet  (0.61 meters) in length,[4]while the typical adult behir was around 40 feet  (12 meters) long[3][4]and weighed about 4,000 pounds  (1,800 kilograms).[3]Behirs reached adulthood at the age of ten and, like other reptilian creatures, would continue to grow throughout their lifetimes, shedding their scales periodically in the process.[6]Because of this, behirs could sometimes reach gargantuan sizes.[3]"
"beholder","Beholders were immediately identifiable, being essentially a floating head with one single,cyclops-like eye surrounded by ten smaller eye stalks. Other than this, the main feature of a beholder's anatomy was its massive, gaping maw. Because of these features, beholders were occasionally known as ""spheres of many eyes"" or ""eye tyrants,""[7]although the latter also referred to a specific type of beholder.[2] Beholders of the Realms tended to be slightly larger than beholders found on other worlds, growing up to six feet in diameter where on other worlds they would average five feet wide. The majority of beholders living on Faerûn had skin colored in cool colors—purples and blues—on the top of their bodies that graduated into earth tones further down. Said skin had a pebbly texture. Most of Toril's beholders had nostrils and jointed, articulated eyestalks.[9] Because their entire body was covered in eyes, beholders had the capacity to see in all directions at once, making it nearly impossible to ambush them while also giving them an unusually high degree of perceptive ability. Although beholders lacked the capacity to see color, they had the ability to perceive even in the most darkened environment, under conditions in which ahumanor similar creature would be rendered completely blind.[7] Beholders were also capable of flight, in spite of their lack of wings or similar physical features, simply hovering above ground effortlessly. The effects of this flight resembled those of thewizardspelllevitation.[7]"
"death kiss","Death kisses resembled beholders but lacked their eyestalks and their mouth below their main eye, and instead were covered in ten, 20-foot-long (6 meters) tentacles ending in mouths. Their bodies were 10 ft  (3 m) across and their leathery skin was a  mottled gray, or a muted hue of the original beholder's skin.[1][2]At the end of each of their tentacles was a toothy mouth, and each tentacle was fully retractable. They could speak through their mouths and they sounded high-pitched and nasally. Only those who were not familiar with beholders could mistake a death kiss for a beholder.[1]"
"death tyrant","A death tyrant was the result of a beholder's mad dreams of existing beyond death. On the rare occasion in which such dreams took hold of a live beholder, its flesh rotted away, and a naked skull with spectral points of red light for eyes would emerge. A death tyrant held much of the powers of the original beholder, now fueled by the power ofUndeath.[2] Although somewhat similar to a zombie, a death tyrant was a much more powerful creature, that continued to lord over others the same way beholders did.[2]On the other hand, a truebeholder zombiewas the result of thenecromanticreanimation of a dead beholder, and although a formidable foe, was a considerably weaker creature and a mindless servant.[6]"
"gauth","A gauth floating body was 4‒6 ft (1.2‒1.8 m) wide in diameter. They had six eyestalks, along with four feeding tendrils that sprouted from the lower half of its body. The most obvious feature of a gauth was its central eye, which was surrounded by a ridge of flesh and 12–15 small ""normal"" eyes used for sight. The most well-known breed was brown and mottled purple and gray, although there were variants of similar color and texture to beholders.[5]"
"gazer","Gazers resembled the beholder who had dreamed them into being with only minor differences. They possessed only four eyestalks rather than ten, and were only 8 inches (20 centimeters) across.[1]"
"spectator","Spectators had 3‒4 ft (0.91‒1.2 m) bodies, which weighed 250 lb  (110 kg).[4][5]They had four eyestalks, as opposed to the typical ten of normal beholders, with two located on either side of the upper half of the body. A spectator's skin was thick, lumpy, and rubbery, with numerous blood vessels visible on the surface.[7]Like regular beholders, they had a single main eye in the middle of their floating bodies.[2]"
"berbalang","The berbalang was a biped, gaunt and lanky. It had leathery skin, which was black in color. It had wide eyes, which glowed and were white. Their eyes could see in the dark. They had a pair of broad, bat-like wings on their back. These allowed the berbalang to fly and could do so with speed and agility. It had very sharp claws and needle-like teeth.[3]"
"bodak","Bodaks resembled their living form to a certain extent, being roughly the same size and shape,[9]though some described them as looking sexless and muscular.[5]Beyond that, there were a number of differences which were immediately obvious to the eye. A bodak's skin was a deathly pale white or gray, devoid of any hair at all. More eerie still was its face, which was twisted into an inhuman visage of sheer madness and horror with empty,[9]milky-white eyes[9][5]outstretched to the shape of vertical ovals.[5]"
"boggle","Boggles were 3‑foot (0.91‑meter) tall creatures,humanoidin shape but who walked hunched over with their knuckles dragging along the floor. A pair of large ears rested on the sides of their bulbous heads. Rubbery and hairless flesh covered their small frames, oddly stretchable and compressible, and ranging from blackish-blue to dark gray in coloration.[3] It was there that the similarities between boggles ended, as past that point they had no common features. Noses could be large, long, flat, or slits, while their limbs could be lanky, or oversized for their diminutive forms. Arms, legs, hands, feet, torso, abdomen, and facial features were all disproportionate in several ways, making individual boggles immediately visually distinct.[3]Old boggles were made recognizable by their lack of elasticity compared to their kin, while younger boggles were far more bouncy.[4]"
"boneclaw","While boneclaws resembled liches in some manners, they were notably different from their undead spellcasting counterparts. They had massive, oversized claws that they used to strike out against their masters' foes.[1][2][4] Their physical forms could never be truly destroyed so long as their master lived and continued their malign ways in life. The physical bodies of boneclaws that were ""destroyed"" merely reformed within hours at their masters' side.[1][2] They were extraordinarily resilient,[4]and possessed a form of innate regeneration.[1][2]"
"bugbear","Bugbears resembled hairy, feral goblins standing 7 feet  (2.1 meters) tall. They took their name from their noses and claws, which were similar to those ofbears.[12]Their claws were not long and sharp enough to be used as weapons, so bugbears often armored and armed themselves with a variety of purloined gear,[3]which was normally  second-rate and in poor repair.[10]"
"bulette","A bulette's body was covered in thick, layered plates. Its head was bullet-shaped, similar to that of a shark, with a massive mouth. It had stumpy but powerful legs.[3] Bulettes were sometimes supposed to be a bizarre cross between an armadillo and a snapping turtle, though there was little evidence to support this theory. Bulettes were heavily armored, however, like either creature, and had a powerful jaw mechanism for snapping up their unsuspecting prey.[9] Bulettes were covered head to toe in armor. Around the head and rear, this armor was a blue-brown color, while in-between the hue might range from gray-blue to blue-green. Areas around the eyes were slightly darkened, with the eyes themselves being a yellow color with blue-green pupils.[9]"
"bullywug","Bullywugs were amphibious humanoids with webbed digits[4]that stood between 5′4″‒6′ (1.6‒1.8 m) and weighed 150​ to ​240 pounds (68​ to ​110 kilograms) on average,[8]although they could vary in body type from 4​ to ​7 feet (1.2​ to ​2.1 meters) and 100​ to ​300 pounds (45​ to ​140 kilograms).[3][9] Their hides were smooth and reasonably tough, with mottled coloration ranging from emerald or olive green, yellow, brown, and gray.[1][10][3][5]Bullywug skin waschameleon-like, so if they remained motionless in swampy terrain, they would shift through different hues and shades of their normal color range to match their surroundings.[1][3][4][5]The creatures were noxious to be around, for they carried with them the rancid reek of the bog.[2][9] The huge heads of bullywugs resembled those of frogs, with big, bulbous eyes, wide mouths,[4][11]and long, flicking tongues. Said tongues were barely capable of navigating a stunted variant ofCommon, and they typically spoke in thick, sloppy accents.[3][9]"
"cadaver collector","Cadaver collectors were 12‑foot-tall (3.7‑meter)humanoidconstructs built of stone and metal that weighed 2 tons  (1,800 kilograms).[2][3]Their long, armored arms nearly dragged along the ground owing to their hunched posture. They possessed a featureless, oblong head with glowing green eye sockets. Spikes of various lengths, some barbed and some not, jutted out from the collector from all sides and along its limbs.[3]In some cases, the cadaver collector would scavenge and embedweaponsinto its armor to provide it with even more spikes.[1]These spikes were often crusted with gore, and as the collector searched for and found bodies of fallen fighters, it adorned these various spikes with the corpses.[3] Cadaver collectors possessed both low-light vision anddarkvision.[3]They required no rest, no air, and no sustenance, and were unaffected bydiseasesortoxins.[1][2]They were said to be resistant if not immune to the effects of theRiver Styx.[4] There was said to exist larger and mightier variations of the cadaver collector, some reaching heights of 30 feet  (9.1 meters) and weighing 15 tons  (14,000 kilograms).[3]"
"carrion crawler","Carrion crawlers were large, pale yellow, and greenish aberrations whose appearance was akin to a 3‒4 ft (0.91‒1.2 m) long centipede. Crawlers possessed eight long tentacles protruding from the sides of their heads, allowing them to stun prey.[6]Carrion crawlers also had two eye stalks, through which they could perceive their surroundings even in the darkest caverns.[2]Additionally, carrion crawlers had a highly developed sense of smell.[6]"
"catoblepas","Catoblepases had the large body of abuffalo, which sat atop squat legs that resembled those of a pachyderm. A catoblepas' head resembled that of a warthog, and sat atop an elongated neck that seemed ill-suited for actual support.[8]Perhaps the most terrifying feature of these beasts were their large and deadly bloodshot eyes.[15] Catoblepases possessed a scent that reeked of death and famine, not dissimilar to the swamp gas that filled their favored environment. The scent was reminiscent ofskunk's stench mixed with foul bog vapors.[1]"
"cave fisher","Cave fishers grew to about 7 feet  (2.1 meters) in length and had a hard, chitinous shell arranged in overlapping plates for an exoskeleton.[3]It had eight legs and two forelimbs that ended in large pincers. Living underground, cave fishers were sightless creatures that used multiple auditory sensor organs to detect prey. These organs were located on the head and could be mistaken for multiple eyes.[5]The creature had a large proboscis from which it shot a long (up to 60 feet  (18 meters)) sticky filament.[1][3][4]"
"centaur","A centaur had the upper body of ahumanoid, and the lower body of a largehorse. They stood around 7 feet  (2.1 meters) tall and weighed approximately 2,100 pounds  (950 kilograms).[4]"
"chimera","A chimera had the hindquarters of a goat, the forequarters of a lion, and a set ofdragonwings. Additionally, a chimera had three heads, that of a horned goat, a lion, and a dragon.[3][2]This head typically resembled ared dragon, though it was not unlikely to find ones with heads resembling other species ofchromatic dragon.[2]"
"chitine","Chitines were about 4 feet  (1.2 meters) tall and had four arms, each of which had an extra joint. Each of their hands and feet were embedded with claws, which allowed them to climb most surfaces. Their faces held faceted eyes and mandibles attached to their mouths. Chitines could spin webs from an opening in their stomach, and their skins secreted an oil which prevented them from sticking to their own webs.[3]"
"choldrith","Choldriths had eight slender legs (although the front two served as arms) and resembled bloated whitespidersabout 9 feet  (2.7 meters) in diameter. Their faces resembled those of chitines, with somehumanoidfeatures, faceted eyes, and mandibles protruding from their mouths. Their ears looked like horns.[2]"
"choker","Chokers had a torso that appeared something akin to ahalfling[3]with spotted gray or brown skin,[4]but the similarity ended there.[3]The flesh of a choker felt rubbery.[1]Some scholars reported that it could alter its skin color to match its surroundings.[2] Its body was roughly humanoid, with a small torso and head,[4]but a choker's arms and legs were long and thin, being more like tentacles than arms or legs of normal creatures.[3][4]The arms could reach out to a distance of at least 10 feet  (3 meters) from its body,[3]and if it stretched its legs out, it would stand about 6 feet  (180 centimeters) tall.[4] Its hands were shaped somewhat like a starfish.[1]The hands had a spiny surface—stiff cartilage jutting through the skin[4]—that permitted them to grip tightly to the surfaces of walls and ceilings[1][3]and to cut through flesh.[4]Even the fingers were enormously long.[4] While there was some debate about the anatomy of a choker's skeleton as a whole—some claimed that the skull, spine, and rib cage were of bone,[3][4]others claimed of cartilage[1]—all scholars agreed that their limbs were cartilaginous[1][2][3][4]and multi-jointed.[2][3][4]They moved their limbs with the fluidity of tentacles.[2][3][4] Standing little higher than 3.5 ft  (110 cm)—if not stretched out[4]—and weighing in at about 35 lb  (16 kg),[3]they were more dangerous than they appeared.[1]"
"chuul","Chuuls have been described as ""a horrible mix of crustacean, insect, and serpent"", but most closely resembled an 8 feet  (2.4 meters) tall yellow-green lobster, weighing around 650 pounds  (290 kilograms) with four long legs, two large claws, a strong protective exoskeleton, a fan-like tail, and a mass of paralysis-causing tentacles around its mouth.[3][4]"
"chwinga","Chwingas stood 0.5‒1.0 ft (15‒30 cm) tall, resembling small animated dolls withmasksfor faces.[1][4]No chwinga masks were alike, and they often took the form of animal faces.[1][4]Their hair was wild and unkempt while their limbs were slender and lean.[1]The presence of chwingas was foreshadowed by mild natural phenomena, such as the presence of harmless insects or pleasant flowery scents.[1]Further indication could be found in cool breezes, and a lusher surrounding scenery.[1]"
"cloaker","Cloakers were almost indistinguishable from large cloaks when then lay dormant, even appearing to have clasps and buttons.[5]When on the move, they appeared like large,leatherystingrays. They had 8 feet  (2.4 meters) wings that unfurled as they flew through the underground caves which they called home, or curled around them as they waited quietly for prey. Their tails were long andwhiplike. Their heads sat within the ""cowl"" of their cloak-like bodies, with red eyes and a toothy maw. Bony claws adjacent to the head looked almost like clasps for the cloak.[1] While their backs and wings were black to assist with camouflage, their bellies were pale. Some had a series of spots that ran in two parallel lines down their backs, which could give the appearance of buttons.[1][5] Their bodies were composed largely of muscle and cartilage.[1]"
"iron cobra","These constructs were typically made ofiron,[3]though some consisted of unknown metals.[5]"
"stone defender","As its name suggested, the stone defender had massive stone slabs affixed to its form to serve as shields. Beyond defense, these slabs aided to a form of camouflage. When the defender stood against a stone or rocky surface, it became imperceptible from its surroundings.[1]"
"cockatrice","Although about the size of a large turkey or goose and weighing 25 lb  (11 kg), a cockatrice more closely resembled a chicken, but it was a hideous hybrid with the wings of abatand alizard-like tail.[4]This tail had yellow-green scales, its bat wings were a grey shade, their feet and beak were yellow, and their feathers were of a golden-brown hue.[6] A male cockatrice had a rooster's wattles and comb, which the females lacked.[4]These wattles and comb, as well as the eyes and tongue of both sexes, were all red.[6]"
"couatl","A couatl resembled a long, feathered serpent with a pair of rainbow-feathered wings that allowed it to fly.[3][5]They were around 12 ft  (3.7 m) in length, with a wingspan of 15 ft  (4.6 m). On average they weighed around 1,800 lb  (820 kg).[3]Some considered their appearance to be among the most beautiful in all of themultiverse.[5]"
"crag cat","Crag cats were grey during most of the year, but they turned white during the winter to better hide in the snow.[1]"
"cranium rat","Cranium rats were indistinguishable from regular variants of their respective species save for their enlarged and exposed brains. It was possible for these brains to emit light.[2]"
"crawling claw","Using their fingers as legs, crawling claws could scuttle across the ground or maneuver on vertical surfaces. Crawling claws were always left hands and had to be made from the hands of small-to-medium-sized creatures. They were known to form into swarms known as ""applauses"" with no discernible front, back, or central body.[3]"
"cyclops","Cyclopes were one of the smallest types of giants, standing only 12 feet  (3.7 meters) and weighing 1,200 pounds  (540 kilograms),[3]but they were as strong as the averagestone giant.[7]Cyclopes had earthy skin tones that blended with their surroundings.[8]Males and females cyclopes of theFeywildwere notably bald and had spiked heads instead of hair.[2]Other cyclops had hair and more human-like appearances.[9][7] The most peculiar and distinguishing thing about cyclopes was the fact that they only had one large eye in the middle of their foreheads. It tended to be the same as the color of their skin. This eye was rumored to causefearin any who looked at it. Their single eye gave them poor depth perception, however, and therefore they couldn't use missile weapons very well.[8]"

"bodak","Bodaks resembled their living form to a certain extent, being roughly the same size and shape,[9]though some described them as looking sexless and muscular.[5]Beyond that, there were a number of differences which were immediately obvious to the eye. A bodak's skin was a deathly pale white or gray, devoid of any hair at all. More eerie still was its face, which was twisted into an inhuman visage of sheer madness and horror with empty,[9]milky-white eyes[9][5]outstretched to the shape of vertical ovals.[5]"

"neogi","Neogi were small eight-legged creatures, the adults no bigger than a small child. They had a head with reflective eyes that sat upon a long eel-like neck.[9]With their hairy flattened abdomen, they were sometimes described as akin to a cross between awolf spiderand aneel.[5]Despite the similarities, neogi were warm-blooded creatures.[7] Neogi frequently dyed their fur and tattooed their bodies, either as decoration or as symbols of family and rank.[7][10]"

"spectator","Spectators had 3‒4 ft (0.91‒1.2 m) bodies, which weighed 250 lb  (110 kg).[4][5]They had four eyestalks, as opposed to the typical ten of normal beholders, with two located on either side of the upper half of the body. A spectator's skin was thick, lumpy, and rubbery, with numerous blood vessels visible on the surface.[7]Like regular beholders, they had a single main eye in the middle of their floating bodies.[2]"

"kuo-toa","Kuo-toa were normally 5 feet  (1.5 meters) tall and weighed approximately 160 pounds  (73 kilograms). Contrasting with their paunchy shape were their arms and legs, slender and lithe despite their relative shortness. At the end of each limb were broad, distended and partially webbed hands and feet. Each extremity had three main digits and one opposing digit at its end. Topping their bodies were bullet-shaped, piscine heads hosting a mouthful of sharp teeth and a pair of bulging silver-black eyes capable of independently swiveling to observe a situation.[2] Their bodies were covered in gray scales with yellowish undertones in males, which could vary in pigmentation based on their emotional state, such as a dark red when angered and a ghostly white when terrified. Coating their rubbery skin and piscine scales was a layer of slippery slime that gave their bodies a glimmering sheen. Normally the only clothing that they wore wereleatherstraps to hold their gear since their slime made conventional armor and leather highly uncomfortable although some donned armor made of seashells. They did have a fondness for accessories of bone, shell, andgems.[2]A light stench of rotten fish was constantly exuded by their bodies.[14]"

"ogrémoch","Ogrémoch was described as a 50 ft  (15 m) tall humanoid made of rock and crystal.[5]His eyes resembled chippedobsidianand his body sparkled withmica. This was by no means an accurate description however, as few could claim to have ever seen him.[3]"

"hook horror","A hook horror stood about 9 feet (2.7 meters) tall and weighed around 400 pounds (181 kilograms), with a head like a vulture, a neck of crested feathers,[6]and the body of abeetle, whose mottled gray,[7]chitinous[6]exoskeleton was extremely thick and dense and covered with sharp studs.[3]The exoskeleton could be removed from a hook horror and transformed into tough armor.[6]Instead of hands, paws, or claws, its front limbs ended in 12-inch-long (30 centimeters) razor-sharp, blade-like gray metallic hooks, surrounded by red feathers.[6]These hooks were the hook horror's primary method of combat. Its legs were similar to those of a bird, and its head was shaped like that of a vulture, including the hooked beak. Its eyes were multifaceted like those of an insect.[1]"

"aboleth","Aboleths were fish-like amphibians of immense size, often reaching 20 feet  (6.1 meters) in length and weighing up to 6,500 pounds  (2,900 kilograms),[10][9]though they continued to grow as they aged and some fantastically ancient specimens might reach 40 feet  (12 meters) in length.[11]They resembled a bizarre eel, with long, tubular bodies, as well as a tail at one end and two fins near the head and another along the back. Aboleths' mouths werelamprey-like, filled with serrated, jawless teeth.[9] Aboleth underbellies were often orange-pink, while their topsides were typically sea-green. A little bit back from the head were four long tentacles, two sprouting from across each other on the top, and two more of the same on the underbelly. Their heads were roughly triangular-shaped, with a spherical, somewhat beak-like nose. Above the nose were their three eyes, each one set atop the other. Tendrils and a few shorter tentacles dangled from the bottom of the head. Four blue-black slime-secreting orifices lined the bottom of their bodies.[9]Aboleth blood was green and thick, oozing like sap.[12] Aboleths breathed through a thick gray mucus-like substance, which covered their body and which they exuded from four pulsating organs along their body as they moved.[10]If robbed of the ability to exude this slime, an aboleth would suffocate in water or on land alike. As such, an aboleth had to take care of its mucus. Out of the water, an aboleth's membrane-like skin dried out quickly, but this did not prove fatal in and of itself. Instead, the aboleth would eventually enter a state of suspended animation, called long dreaming, a fate considered far worse than simply dying amongst aboleths. During this process, the so-hampered aboleth formed a tough, waterproof membrane. However, if this membrane was pierced, liquid flooded out and death was usually not far off for the aboleth.[13] Aboleths did not die of old age and so lived on indefinitely, barring violence or disease.[13]"

"harpy","A harpy had the upper body of a femalehumanoidand the lower body of a reptilian creature, with scaly legs, clawed feet, and clawed hands with knotty fingers. Harpies had coal-black eyes in faces like cruel old women, with hair that was filthy, tangled, and crusted with old dry blood. They possessed powerful leathery wings with which they could fly and carry away their victims.[3][note 1] Harpies did not wear any clothing,[3]but would adorn themselves with jewelry or trinkets from their victims.[6] There was no physical difference between male and female harpies. The males possessed breasts just like the females did, leading to the misconception that male harpies did not exist.[7]"

"yochlol","Yochlols had four forms available to them:ooze,humanoid,spider, and gaseous.[1] In their natural form yochlols were 6‒7 ft (1.8‒2.1 m) tall and weighed 250 lb  (110 kg).[3]Their yellow, oozy, bodies seemed to be constantly melting and piling back up like a sickening living candle.[4]This waxy exterior constantly effused a foul stench. They were visually akin toropers, with eight writhing, powerful tentacles and a pillar-like main body with a single, sinister, scarlet eye in the middle.[10] Their most seen form, however, was that of an attractive, slenderhumanorelvenfemale, normally adrow. This form could not be crafted in such a way as to replicate other individuals, and was around 6 inches taller than typical for a member of that race. They could not morph clothes and so had to keep some nearby when entering this form.[4] Yochlols could also become giant arachnids with a leg span of 8 ft  (2.4 m) and weighing 160 lb  (73 kg). This man-sized form appeared to be a massiveblack widowwith a pair of dangerous fangs.[4] Yochlol were visually similar toalkilithin many ways, particularly in their ability to take on a gaseous appearance.[10]This form was a green cloud of murky smoke vaguely similar to that of its true form. It had the same pillar like body 10 ft  (3 m) high and 5 ft  (1.5 m) wide in diameter, and could manifest several pseudopods at will.[3][4]Their oily vapor was still just as malodorous as the reeking of their sludge form.[8]"

"moloch","Standing over 14.5 ft  (4.42 m) tall, Moloch had a powerful, almost square physique. His short arms and legs were especially thick and ended in enormous hands and feet that were both cubic and clawed.[3]He had reddish-orange skin and a bestial visage, his huge, horned head hosting fiery, slanting, unblinking eyes and a salivating, gaped mouth filled withshark-like teeth.[3][5]"

"mongrelfolk","Mongrelfolk werehumanoidin shape but wildly varied in appearance.[2][3]Common traits for mongrelfolk included a 5‒7 ft (1.5‒2.1 m) tall[4]figure between 125‒230 lb (56.7‒100 kg).[3]Skin tones varied from pale to dark, and their hair ranged from smooth to rough, and from black to brown. Their eyes could seem black in the dark, and yet pale in the light and their ears were slightly wide and long, with broad noses and heavy jaws.[2][3]All of these traits however were highly variable, and could just as easily be replaced with those of other races.[4] Mongrelmen were known to contain pieces from many others species, includingdwarves,elves, andhumans,goblins,hobgoblins, andbugbears, as well asorcsandogres. Even stranger possibilities included creatures likebullywugs,crabmen,lizardfolk,gnolls,minotaurs, and evensatyrs.[4][5]However, mongrelfolk could appear to be mildly unusual members of other races by hiding their more outlandish features.[3]"
