Aarakocra resembled humanoid birds. The average specimen stood about 5 feet  (1.5 meters) tall and had a wingspan of 20 feet  (6.1 meters). Halfway along the edge of each wing was a hand with three human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. An elongated fourth finger extended the length of the wing and locked in place during flight. The hands could not grasp while flying, but they were nearly as useful ashumanhands when an aarakocra was perched and its wings were folded back.[3][note 1] Their powerful legs ended in four sharp talons that could unlock and fold back to reveal another pair of functional hands. These humanoids had hollow, fragile bones. Their faces combined the features of bothparrotsandeagles. They had gray-black beaks and black eyes. Plumage color varied, but males generally had red, orange, and yellow coloration, while females tended towards brown and gray.[3]<|eot_id|>"}

Aboleths' mouths werelamprey-like, filled with serrated, jawless teeth.[9] Aboleth underbellies were often orange-pink, while their topsides were typically sea-green. A little bit back from the head were four long tentacles, two sprouting from across each other on the top, and two more of the same on the underbelly. Their heads were roughly triangular-shaped, with a spherical, somewhat beak-like nose. Above the nose were their three eyes, each one set atop the other. Tendrils and a few shorter tentacles dangled from the bottom of the head. Four blue-black slime-secreting orifices lined the bottom of their bodies.[9]Aboleth blood was green and thick, oozing like sap.[12] Aboleths breathed through a thick gray mucus-like substance, which covered their body and which they exuded from four pulsating organs along their body as they moved.[10]If robbed of the ability to exude this slime, an aboleth would suffocate in water or on land alike. As such, an aboleth had to take care of its mucus. Out of the water, an aboleth's membrane-like skin dried out quickly, but this did not prove fatal in and of itself. Instead, the aboleth would eventually enter a state of suspended animation, called long dreaming, a fate considered far worse than simply dying amongst aboleths. During this process, the so-hampered aboleth formed a tough, waterproof membrane. However, if this membrane was pierced, liquid flooded out and death was usually not far off for the aboleth.[13] Aboleths did not die of old age and so lived on indefinitely, barring violence or disease.[13]<|eot_id|>"}

Some were described as lean and quick with long, lanky limbs but others were more akin toogresseswith gnarled muscles and jutting bones comprising their hulking frames.[4][7]Such annis hags, even with their hunched backs and humped shoulders, were still massive,[1]and known to weigh around 325 lb  (147 kg).[2]Their stretched skin was covered in scars and blemishes, and they had a blue-black complexion as if their flesh had been deeply bruised.[7][1] An annis hag's nails were not simply as sharp as blades, but were actually made of iron that magically grew like the keratin nails of normalhumanoids. Normally they were 3 in  (76 mm) long but often stylized by annis hags into long spirals that could inflict unnerving, circular wounds. They were naturally a glossy shade of black but like ordinary steel would oxidize over time, turning their shiny nails into rusted corkscrews.[7]Their sharpened teeth[3]were also metallic and their filthy hair had a similar luster.[2][4]Above an annis's dull, greenish-yellow eyes[5]were a pair of black, upward-arching horns barely longer than a human's thumbs. The nubs were seemingly vestigial, neither long enough to reach enemies or hardy enough to pierce them.[7] An annis with atroll's hand grafted onto her own rises from the swamp with his former kin. Prone to bodily modification, annis hags were known to deeply scar themselves and use grafts in order to augment their already grotesque features to make themselves even more terrifying. One was said to have chewed through their cheeks to etch a gangrenous grin on their faces and there rumors of an annis that stitched the members of her coven onto her back, trapping her flailing sisters in a semi-conscious state.[7]Normally they wore disheveled peasant's clothes but when needed they could use their illusory abilities to blend into other societies in a variety of ways.

Other than this, the main feature of a beholder's anatomy was its massive, gaping maw. Because of these features, beholders were occasionally known as \"spheres of many eyes\" or \"eye tyrants,\"[7]although the latter also referred to a specific type of beholder.[2] Beholders of the Realms tended to be slightly larger than beholders found on other worlds, growing up to six feet in diameter where on other worlds they would average five feet wide. The majority of beholders living on Faerûn had skin colored in cool colors—purples and blues—on the top of their bodies that graduated into earth tones further down. Said skin had a pebbly texture. Most of Toril's beholders had nostrils and jointed, articulated eyestalks.[9] Because their entire body was covered in eyes, beholders had the capacity to see in all directions at once, making it nearly impossible to ambush them while also giving them an unusually high degree of perceptive ability. Although beholders lacked the capacity to see color, they had the ability to perceive even in the most darkened environment, under conditions in which ahumanor similar creature would be rendered completely blind.[7] Beholders were also capable of flight, in spite of their lack of wings or similar physical features, simply hovering above ground effortlessly. The effects of this flight resembled those of thewizardspelllevitation.[7]<|eot_id|>"}

Noses could be large, long, flat, or slits, while their limbs could be lanky, or oversized for their diminutive forms. Arms, legs, hands, feet, torso, abdomen, and facial features were all disproportionate in several ways, making individual boggles immediately visually distinct.[3]Old boggles were made recognizable by their lack of elasticity compared to their kin, while younger boggles were far more bouncy.[4]<|eot_id|>"}

Bulettes were heavily armored, however, like either creature, and had a powerful jaw mechanism for snapping up their unsuspecting prey.[9] Bulettes were covered head to toe in armor. Around the head and rear, this armor was a blue-brown color, while in-between the hue might range from gray-blue to blue-green.

Some purported that females were generally bigger and stronger than males,[23]while others claimed the males had superior strength.[28]Both sexes varied in height from 4 feet and ​7 inches​ to ​5 feet and ​5 inches (140​ to ​170 centimeters), averaging at 5 feet  (150 centimeters).

However, with the exception of the First House, insignias weren't openly displayed except when inside the House territory or the clan's base.[32][32] Noble drow wore clothes and equipment of superior quality (except, of course, when they didn't want to attract attention).[33]For example, a noble'shouse insigniadidn't just show house allegiance but also carried magic that could be used on command.[32]Web chokers' were considered fashionable by drow priestesses,[34]who also often used powderedOrmu, an Underdark-moss, as eye shadow.[35]<|eot_id|>"}

Beyond their two heads, ettins often resembledhillorstone giants, but upon closer examination even hill giants seemed civilized compared to them.[4]They were hulking creatures[3]with exceptionally broad shoulders,[7]long arms,[8]and great weight. Reports of their heaviness ranged from around 1,000 pounds  (450 kilograms) to exceeding 5,000 pounds  (2,300 kilograms), although either way the earth shook when they ran.[8][3][6]Strangely, they were slightly lop-sided, the right side being slightly more muscular and well-developed than the left, although not enough to detract from their barbaric image.[7] In regards to their savage aspect, one of their most notable traits was their skin; if given a choice, ettins never bathed, and so their already thick skin was crusted over with a thick layer of dirty grime, giving them a horrid stench and a gray-dark brown complexion.[1][3][4]Underneath the filth, ettins had skin tone ranging from pink to brownish, with yellow-tinged hands and feet marked with callouses.[7][4] Even ignoring their unwillingness to clean themselves, ettins had no concern for their appearance and lacked any kind of grooming habits, even negative ones.[7][4]Atop their ugly heads[9]was a hanging, unkempt mess of long, stringy hair,[1][4]and inside their large, reeking mouths were crooked, yellow, and all too often rotten teeth. Notably, ettins had crude,orc-like traits in the form of a large, watery eyes, porcine snouts, and shovel jaws with lower canine teeth that protruded out like boar tusks, tusks that, for all their easiness to reach, were as revoltingly rotten as the rest of their teeth.[1][3][4] This uncleanliness extended to their sense of dress, or lack thereof; ettins wore animal skins that were uncured, unwashed, scraggly, and that were typically decaying and being eaten by moths.[7][5]The only reason they wore them was as a kind of mobileblanket, giving them something soft and warm to sleep in, and the ugly sleeping-furs normally didn't include sleeves or any unnecessary parts so as not to impede them in physically demanding tasks.[7]This wasn't to say that the idea of accessories was completely beyond them, with some keeping things like severed heads as accessories and females being known to wear jewelry as a status symbol.[7][10] Generally males were taller and heavier than females, but females, as well as having longer hair, were often fuller-bodied than the relatively gaunt and wiry males.[7][6]<|eot_id|>"}

Because their predominant scale hue ran the colors of the rainbow over their lifetime, their color was a direct indicator of their age and power. The scales of a young hatchling were almost always red, and those of a fully mature dragon (over 50 years old) were violet.[1]<|eot_id|>"}

In their eye sockets flickered gleaming emerald lights filled with malice.[3][2]As they flew, small jets of flame trailed after them. They moved in total silence, and were heard only when they spoke, cast spells, or screamed for intimidation or just for effect.[4]They sometimes made insane, echoing laughter,[1]but spoke in hollow, echoing voices.[5]<|eot_id|>"}

Their bodies were hollow, with a small circular hole at the center of their topside. They had a pair of 6‑inch-long (15‑centimeter) eyestalks on either side of the central hole, as well as numerous tentacles and small spikes that grew from the underside.[4] Flumphs floated about 4​ to ​6 inches (10​ to ​15 centimeters) above the ground[4]by means of an innate anti-gravity field,[7]and moved by using air jets as propulsion. The air circulated through the flumph's body by entering in the central upper cavity and exiting from small holes in its underside and from apertures along the rim of its body.[4]In fact, they were named after the characteristic whistling sound made by these jets,[1]which could only be heard in quiet areas and produced a gentle breeze. Their more peripheral tentacles were very dextrous and were capable of manipulating small objects.[4] Common flumphs were white, while monastic flumphs were pale yellow or green, with tentacles ending in darker shades.[4]Flumphs also glowed faintly in different colors depending on their mood.[1]<|eot_id|>"}

Identified by their pointed ears, angled faces, and apparent agelessness, they resembled gigantic, purple-skinnedelves.[11] Accursed fomorians were as misshapen and strange as they were varied in appearance. Often disproportionate and exaggerated, some had thick and stocky builds, while others were contortionists with long and sinewy limbs that possessed enough gripping strength to crawl along walls and ceilings.[12]They had hunchbacks, crooked appendages, conic heads, flapping ears, twisted toes, oversized noses, or tiny mouths. Scrambled facial features, such as eyes on the wrong side of the head, were also common.[9][6][7]Many fomorians had one eye that far outsized the other. This \"evil eye\" emitted light and differed in iris color as well as pupil shape, often resembling acat's eye.[13][3] Their deformed bodies were covered in large warts, wandering pustules, and weeping lesions. Internally, their veins and organs bulged and lurched. Their skin tone commonly matched that ofhill giants, but also ranged from purplish-gray to pale white. Hairlessness was relatively common among fomorians of bothsexes,[3]though some were known to have scattered patches of wriggling hair that was as tough aswire.[7]There was no single odor associated with them – some left no scent, while others smelled strongly due to rainbow-hued fluids produced by overactive sweat glands.[6][13] They largely wore makeshift scraps of cloth,[9]though some were known to dress in kilts andtabardsof fine quality.[3][14][note 1]They tended to work any bits of metal or pieces of armor they could find and scavenge into their clothes for added protection.[6][7]<|eot_id|>"}

The nostrils were on short stalks, and the three eyes, which were greenish-tinged amber with vertical, bright green edged with orange pupils, were similarly located on retractable appendage.[3][4]Fully grown froghemoths weighed 5 tons  (4,500 kg).[2] Immature froghemoths, calledtadhemoths, looked fish-like, with four pectoral fins and two tails (which became tentacles and legs respectively) hatched from eggs about 1 ft  (0.3 m) in diameter, and grew a foot each month for six months, and then a foot every two months until they reached full size. The tentacles started developing at the six-month mark, and the legs started developing by the tenth month. After twelve months, the creature was fully mature. Tadhemoths were fully aquatic and relied on gills to breathe.[3][4] Ancient froghemoth, known asfroghemoth elders, were unmatched in their size and strength among froghemoths. Their immense size was often the result of dining on weaker froghemoths, but could also evolve from being raised in unnatural environs. These elders developed alien abilities that warped the surrounding ecosystem.[5]<|eot_id|>"}

For example, those from areas with large amounts of quartz deposits might have a more quartz-like composition.Granite-like galeb duhr were the most common variety. Galeb duhr never had bodies made from sandstone or other such sedimentary rock.[7] Galeb duhr ranged in size from four feet (one meter) in height to as large as sixteen feet (five meters).[3] They were very slow-moving creatures[5][7][3]with a steady gait.

As such, they were much faster at crawling and climbing. Like giant spiders, they had the ability to climb awkwardly shaped walls and hang upside down on ceilings, sense when a creature was caught in their web, and travel well across webbing.[1] They were less strong than giant spiders, but were more intelligent, robust, and wise. As such, when combined with their superior speed, they were fantastic stalkers. This allowed them to hunt their foes across plains, underground, or in burrows.[1] Wolf spiders were said to have very good eyesight and potentially even a basic sense of smell.[3]In addition, they tracked their prey by the use of their scent-detecting organs, which were located in their pedipalps.[4] Female wolf spiders were incredibly protective of their offspring, which often numbered in the hundreds. As such, they were known to carry their offspring in little cocoons under their stomachs, or sometimes the offspring would even ride their mothers.[4]<|eot_id|>"}

They had muscular forelimbs and their hands had opposable thumbs. These creatures stood upright erect and moved about in quick, short hops. Unlike frogs and toads, however, grung were incapable of long leaps.[2] The evolution of grung gave them intelligence, opposable thumbs, and ingenuity, but took away their prehensile tongues, which were common among other amphibian races. This adaptation left grung with wide, sharp teeth-filled mouths. Their bright-colored skins were kept slick and wet as they breathed through them. Grung eyes were comparatively smaller than those of frogs or toads and were crowned with hard protective ridges. Their eye color was red with black pupils.[2] Grungs reproduced by laying eggs, which hatched into grey tadpoles which metamorphosed into amphibious humanoids over three months, and into adults over another six to nine months[2]by which time their skin had adopted the bright colors which would identify their castes.[3]Grungs reproduced quickly: one chieftain namedYorbhad at least one hundred and eighty children, and that was just his sons.[4]<|eot_id|>"}

Head and torso were covered with soft feathers, a dark russet-brown color, while their scrawny limbs were bare and scaled like a bird's.[4]They most resembledravens.[3] Kenku tended to be slightly smaller than the averagehuman, standing at around 5 feet  (1.5 meters). Because they had partially hollow bones, they were lighter than most creatures their height, averaging only 75 pounds  (34 kilograms).

Each extremity had three main digits and one opposing digit at its end. Topping their bodies were bullet-shaped, piscine heads hosting a mouthful of sharp teeth and a pair of bulging silver-black eyes capable of independently swiveling to observe a situation.[2] Their bodies were covered in gray scales with yellowish undertones in males, which could vary in pigmentation based on their emotional state, such as a dark red when angered and a ghostly white when terrified. Coating their rubbery skin and piscine scales was a layer of slippery slime that gave their bodies a glimmering sheen. Normally the only clothing that they wore wereleatherstraps to hold their gear since their slime made conventional armor and leather highly uncomfortable although some donned armor made of seashells.

Deer-like legs ending in cloven hooves were far more concrete in their resemblance, but nonetheless made it impossible to distinguish between the tracks of a leucrotta and a stag.[2][1]Ending the mismatched creature's form was a tuftedlion-like tail. Male and females were indistinguishable without an in-depth examination.[7]The laughter of a leucrotta was made distinctive, as it was a cross between hyena andhuman.[6] The patchwork features of leucrottas did not make their hideous appearance inevitable. In fact, a leucrotta could be a handsome, and even a humorous looking beast if those were its only traits. Instead, the horrible appearance of the leucrottas was a result of their more off-putting characteristics, such as their glowing red eyes, constant drooling, and jagged bony ridges in place of teeth. Other eerie features were their oily, putrid, skin that was colored a motley of black, gray, and brown.[3]The notably noxious stench that hung off their bodies was topped only by their awful breath, corrupted by a combination of digestive fluid and carrion. A pinkdog-like tongue further contributed to their hodgepodge physical structure. Their generally ghoulish appearance was furthered by their skeletal form and lack of close-cropped fur.[7] There also existed a legendaryfiendishspecies of leucrottas that were three times the size of theirMaterial Planecounterparts, reaching 30 ft  (9.1 m) in length.[8]<|eot_id|>"}

When they were enraged or excited maurezhi were incredibly erratic.[2] Their facial features were more bestial than those of regular ghouls, with maws that sloped into short muzzles filled with serrated fangs and long, pointed ears similar to those of a cat.[2][3]Their ears were not their only cat-like structures, as their lengthy fingers ended in filth-ridden claws and their powerful legs allowed them to sprint and pounce like a big cat. Reports varied on whether or not they could truly speak when not communicating telepathically, or if they could only vocalize wild grunts, loud shrieks, and wicked howls.[3]<|eot_id|>"}

Irregular patches of an angry red hue coated the bodies of 85% of all meazels, caused by a noncontagious skin disease that gave them a leprous and disfigured appearance.[6] Most meazels had clawed hands and webbed digits that suited the boggy areas they normally occupied, and their sickly skin was contrasted by their jet black eyes. Male and female meazels did both exist, but the two were practically indistinguishable.[6]<|eot_id|>"}

Despite those features, from large distances they could easily be mistaken by ordinaryhumans.[3][5]For that reason, it was common for medusae to hide their features behind hoods or veils.[3] People cursed into becoming medusae could belong to either sex[1]and both male and female medusae created by such curses were similar in form and capabilities.[10]<|eot_id|>"}

Their claws dragged along the ground due to their hunched-over bodies and they moved slower than most because of it. Cysts and sores covered their grotesque hides, underneath shaggy hair like spines that coated their bodies. Their yellow, pupil-less, insectoid eyes easily pierced the darkness, but they struggled to see during the day. Unlike the rest of their bodies, their heads were white and hairless, with flat noses and small toothy mouths.[3][4]<|eot_id|>"}

Also distinguishing them from humans were the gills slits along their necks, the slight webbing between their fingers, and their pupils exhibiting an ice blue or pale silver tone.[6] On average, mermen grew to be around 8 feet  (2.4 meters) in length[2][6]and had broader shoulders, while mermaids grew only slightly shorter.[6]On average they weighed around 400 lb  (180 kg)[2]and it was unheard of for merfolk to become overweight, due to their active lifestyles, and possessed greater strength than their physiques would imply.[6] The coloration of their eyes, hair, and skin varied as much as those of humans, as did the coloration of their fins and scales—some colorations being more common in certain areas. Merfolk acrossFaerûnexhibited all the varied skin tones of the continent's humans. They tended towards pale pink or tan, though some around theAlamber SeaandVilhon Reachhad darker tones. The most common hair colors were light brown or blond, as these helped them to better blend in to their environment. The rarest of hair colors were blue and silver—those born with either were considered to have great destinies and so would be raised and watched over by their entire clan.[6] The coloration of merfolk fins and scales ranged from a deep kelly green to a brilliant silver, though some colorations outside of this could be found. SomeSerôsianmerfolk exhibited brighter colors and even scales that were striped or speckled. While some merfolk in the Alamber Sea or Vilhon Reach had scales that ranged from copper to golden.[6]During winter seasons, merfolk tails shed their old scales.[7] In terms of clothing, merfolk often adorned themselves with shells and coral.[2]And Serôsian merfolk in particular had a widespread practice oftattooingacross their culture.[8]<|eot_id|>"}

While their right arms normally wielded a weapon their left forearms were bloated and studded with iron, with a small vestigial hand limply hanging from the limb.[3]All merregons were identical, and the only way to tell them apart was to check the metal masks bolted to their faces which indicated their commander and the layer of the Nine Hells they were assigned to.[1][3]<|eot_id|>"}

They could assume any shape, provided that they retained the same volume.[5]In order to most effectively lure adventurers, they most commonly took the shape of doors, chests, and other objects likely to be touched. Their skin texture and color could change to almost perfectly resemble wood, stone, metal, and other basic materials,[1][5]though the natural state of a mimic's skin was a rough speckled grey similar togranite.[5][7]<|eot_id|>"}

The tentacles could range in length from 2​ to ​4 feet (0.61​ to ​1.2 meters), appearing shorter when an illithid was at rest. They writhed and undulated almost constantly and absent-mindedly while the illithid pondered or otherwise was not using them,[7][18][20]and flexed in anticipation when sentient beings drew close.[1]They were also incredibly dexterous, powerful, and could be fully controlled by the mind flayer to perform both fine and strength-based tasks.[18][20] In many apocryphal descriptions and diagrams, mind flayers were portrayed as having beaked mouths, possibly owing to their octopus-like heads.[20]In reality, an illithid's mouth was more like that of alamprey, with a circular, jawless orifice ringed by several rows of small, rasping teeth.[15][17][18]The tentacles hung above and around their mouths[17][18]and an oily slime constantly dripped out of their maws.[4]Illithids did not possess exterior ears, rather hosting small, fleshy, ridged holes on both sides of their heads,[20]nor did they have nostrils.[17]Their eyes, sheltered by brow ridges, were uniformly pale and devoid of pupils[18]in addition to being bloated and featureless, similar to those of blindcave fish.[4][20] Illithid hands were long, slender, and lacked an index finger, but were otherwise similar to those of normal humanoid creatures. The remaining fingers and opposable thumb were red to mauve in coloration, and their nails were thick and black. Though illithid nails seemed dangerous, they were actually blunt and composed of soft cartilage, and so had little hope of being effective weapons. Illithid feet were webbed and had only two toes, which were also nailed and could flex widely apart, as if to assist in swimming.[7][17][18] Illithids were known to dress in dramatic flowing robes and cloaks.[15]They were rarely seen without distinctively two-lobed boots, which concealed their webbed feet.[17]They often wore high, flaring collars, dark hats, and various other pieces of ornamentation.[15]<|eot_id|>"}

They had to work hard to keep their skin hydrated—such as by taking frequent baths or by consuming liquids—or else it would begin to desiccate.[5] They detested—but were not generally harmed by—bright lights, extreme temperatures, and lack of food.[7]<|eot_id|>"}

However, a mindwitness's mind flayer influence made an already horrifying creature arguably even more so; its fanged mouth was replaced with one more akin to that of alamprey, and this maw was surrounded by four large octopus-like tentacles.[2] A mindwitness's body was, like that of a beholder, naturally buoyant, allowing it to fly and granting it effects much like that of afeather fallspell. Its many eyes granted it 360 degree vision, preventing it from being flanked and making it generally very difficult to avoid being spotted by one. Mindwitnesses also had an innate resistance to spells and were able to project anantimagic fieldin a cone in front of them.[2] A mindwitness was able to communicatetelepathicallywith any creature that had a language, and was itself able to speak both its own language andCommon.[2]<|eot_id|>"}

Minotaurs were large, muscularhumanoids. They had the head of a bull, upper torso, hands, and the body of a human,[20]and hooved feet. Their fur and wild hair typically ranged from brown to black.[4][1]The fur often covered forearms, chest, abdomen, and legs. Males were referred to as bulls and reached up to 9 feet  (2.7 meters) in height, while females – cows, were similar in appearance, with broader hips, humanoid breasts, and reached only 7 feet  (2.1 meters).[16] Minotaur bodies were of similar shape and build to that of anogre. Their hands were huge and strong, ending in thick sharp yellow nails. Minotaurs were known to use claws in battle, but they were brittle and did not survive heavy use. Despite their heads being that of a bull, there were subtle differences in features between mundane beasts and minotaurs. Some were known to have cow-like tails; however, that trait was not common. Their snouts were thicker and longer than that of an animal, and bull-men had sharp carnivore teeth. Their canines were especially noticeable, and minotaurs never hesitated to bite their victims, prey, and opponents. Lastly, unlike bovines, minotaurs' eyes were positioned closer to the center of their faces, granting them good depth perception and another telltale evidence of their predatory nature.[16] The creatures' iconic feature – their horns – were very similar to normal bulls', slightly curving forward. Both males and females had similarly shaped huge horns. However, males' were longer and thicker on average. There were several horn coloring variations, and sometimes as many as three colors could be present. Minotaurs with dark fur often had dark yellow or brown horns.[16]The shortest horns were around 1 foot  (0.3 meters) and could reach up to three times that length.[21]<|eot_id|>"}

Although it was normally a greataxe, its form was often dependent on the demon lord they served, such as manifesting as aflailforYeenoghu.[1]Jagged runes were carved into the weapon and a shimmering ruby laid within the base of the shaft.[3]If a molydeus was slain, its weapon dissolved into a puddle of ichor.[2]<|eot_id|>"}

Early descriptions of morkoths were vague and suggested they werehumanoid,[4]but as these mysterious creatures got involved in the affairs of other races, a more accurate picture emerged.[2][3][4]Many described their bodies as looking like gross amalgamations of various species, including such creatures aselves,humans,kuo-toas,locathahs, andsquids.[5] Morkoths had a dark coloration to their skin that varied from a deep purple to an inky black. The skin on the tips and undersides of their limbs[5]had luminescent quality, glowing a faint silver in the deep gloom.[3][5]Their heads had gills and were described as being akin to that of a locathah[5]complete with wide jaws,[2][3][4][5]filled with many sharp teeth that were visible even when their mouth was closed,[2][3][4]but others were described as having a beak similar to that of a squid,[2][3][4][5]octopus, or kraken.[5][5]This trait was predominant among those that dwelled in the Inner Sea.[5]The eyes of a morkoth were akin tofish, being on the sides of its eyes, wide,[5]bulging,[2]and moving independently of each other.[5]Additionally, those outside of the Inner Sea were sometimes said to have dorsal fin that went down the center of their back.[3] Morkoth bodies were overalloctopoidal, with eightoctopus-like tentacles making up the lower half of their body.[3][5]They maneuvered themselves through bodies of water through a combination of flexing their lower halves and jet propulsion, the latter caused by pressurizing their surroundings through a rapid intake of water through gills and other orifices.[5]Four forelimbs protruded from their midsections. While most accounts spoke of these resembling the claws and pincer limbs of alobster,[3][5]those of the Inner Sea could also be born with additional flexible tentacles or two or more human-like arms and hands that varied in their amount of fingers. In the Outer Seas, those born with the lobster-like appendages had scales along their body, while those of the Inner Sea had chitinous plates.[5] Young adult morkoths measured about 6 feet  (1.8 meters) on average,[2][3][4]though older specimens could grow larger.[2]<|eot_id|>"}

A little larger and heavier than females, a fully grown male specimen stood 8 feet  (2.4 meters) high and weighed 1,300​ to ​1,500 pounds (590​ to ​680 kilograms),[8][9][7][5]had 2‑inch (5.1‑centimeter) claws, and darker coats than females.[8][9][7] An owlbear (side view). Other traits were less obvious but still significant. An owlbear could rotate its forearms as ahumancould, granting it greater strength and agility than a regular bear, giving it a wider range of attack, and enabling it to 'hug' and grapple prey. Moreover, while it had forward-facing eyes like both bears and owls, it also could rotate its head up to 270°, owing to it having fourteen neckbones (humans had seven and could only turn through 180°), and it could whip its head around with shocking speed. They had a transparent third eyelid (known as a nictitating membrane) to guard against dust, dirt, and bright light. Unusually, an owlbear's ears were asymmetric, with one somewhat higher than the other, letting it exactly locate the origin of any sound. Finally, owlbears had the same long tongues as bears, so it could lap up liquids the same way.[14]They could be surrounded by a pungent stink.[15]<|eot_id|>"}

The shadow did not usually resemble the shape of the beast; instead, it was said to appear as the outline of whatever creature whose heart the peryton last ate,[3]usually an adult human.[4]Other reports suggested that the peryton's shadow wasalwaysthat of a human, and a legend told that they had once been humans themselves, hence the human shadow.[10]There was some controversy as to when and what shadow would be cast by a peryton. Some argued that the only time a peryton cast its own shadow was immediately after killing a victim but before consuming it.[7]Others said that a peryton's shadow reverted to its own onlyaftereating a heart and for a brief period afterwards.[4]Some attributed this phenomenon specifically to the female.

Their primary feature was of course their wings.[4][6][7][8][3][10] Extending from their well-muscled shoulders, these wings were formed like abat's, being divided into arc-segments by hollow elongated \"finger\" bones.[6][7][8]However, the leathery membranes between these bones were covered in feathers. These wings had a maximum wingspan of 3 feet  (0.91 meters).[4][6][7][8][3] Tressym were fluffy[6][7][8][10]and their coat varied in color and length as much as regular cats. The majority were short-haired, with black, gray, or tabby fur.[6][7][8] Some tressym hadowl-like faces with tufts of fur at the points of their ears. The fingers of their wings could end in ornate feathers with circular designs rather like the \"eyes\" of apeacock's plumage.[6][7][8][note 1] They were widely considered to be cute or beautiful.[6][7][8][10]<|eot_id|>"}

The unique nature of the altered tadpole was not apparent until it underwent the process ofceremorphosis, where the usual procedures of morphological alteration to the host body were altered and the resulting mind flayer displayed a pair of unusually long mouth tentacles not seen in other illithids.[2] Ulitharids also exhibited psychological changes in addition to the physical, demonstrating a harsher, more spiteful temperament than other mind flayers.[2]Ulitharids were also quite rare within mind flayer enclaves: between 1-in-25 and 1-in-100 illithid tadpoles would develop into an ulitharid.[3][2] According toVolothamp Geddarm, ulitharids were also key to the expansion of illithid society, as they are the caste of mind flayers capable of eventually metamorphosing intoelder brains; an ulitharid that grew sick of fighting its parent elder brain for power would take a substantial part of the colony to a new area, whereupon its brain would be placed in a new or reclaimed brain pool and be merged with the brains of other illithids to become a larval elder brain, capable of supporting illithid larva and expanding their empire. The only restriction on this process was that the ulitharid could not die of old age, as their brains would be too decrepit for the process. To that end, an ulitharid often carried an extractor staff, a device that would allow it to remove its own brain when the brain pool was ready, which would also recycle its body into psionically-active sludge that would assist the new elder brain in adapting to its pool, and could serve as a useful melee weapon in a fight.<|eot_id|>"}

Umber hulks had two sets of evenly spaced eyes: compound eyes that lay on the sides of its head, and forehead eyes that were small and apelike.[7][3]They were extremely bulky creatures, often standing 4.5​ to ​5 feet (1.4​ to ​1.5 meters) or 8​ to ​9 feet (2.4​ to ​2.7 meters) tall.

In addition, their powerful arms and legs both ended in tough claws, able to rip through rock with ease. Rather than a nose, they had a series of gill-like openings in their almost non-existent necks, potentially due to aquatic origins.[8]Owing to their wide and heavy bodies, they couldn't properly maneuver in open spaces and ended up lumbering around when not traversing their tunnels.[7]As indicated by their name, their hides were mostly black, although their front was usually burnt brown or yellowish gray.[8]<|eot_id|>"}
