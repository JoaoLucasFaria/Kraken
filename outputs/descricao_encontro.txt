The sky was a deep, foreboding grey.
It seemed to press down on the peaks of the mountains, which were capped with a thin layer of snow that glistened in the faint sunlight.
The air was cold and crisp, with a biting wind that howled through the valleys.
A few wispy clouds drifted lazily through the sky, casting long, ominous shadows over the peaks.
