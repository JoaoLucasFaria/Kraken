"aarakocra","A powerful aarakocra warrior fromChult. Aarakocra resembled humanoid birds. The average specimen stood about 5 feet  (1.5 meters) tall and had a wingspan of 20 feet  (6.1 meters). Halfway along the edge of each wing was a hand with three human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. An elongated fourth finger extended the length of the wing and locked in place during flight. The hands could not grasp while flying, but they were nearly as useful ashumanhands when an aarakocra was perched and its wings were folded back.[3][note 1] Their powerful legs ended in four sharp talons that could unlock and fold back to reveal another pair of functional hands. These humanoids had hollow, fragile bones. Their faces combined the features of bothparrotsandeagles. They had gray-black beaks and black eyes.

Anyanimalsin this territory were considered fair game, including the domesticated livestock of other races, and most male aarakocra spent their days hunting. The eldest male served as leader, assisted by the tribe's shaman. Meanwhile, female aarakocra crafted the tribe's tools and weapons.[3] Aarakocra were also one of the major races on the inner planetColiar. On that planet, it was the females who were always chosen as leaders, as society deemed them far more controlled emotionally. These aarakocra females were chosen by democratic elections, and each ruled over one of over 100 extended families. Males were not forbidden from running for office, but society was strongly against their election, and as of the late 14thcenturyDR, no male had ruled for over 1,000 years.

"aboleth","Aboleths were fish-like amphibians of immense size, often reaching 20 feet  (6.1 meters) in length and weighing up to 6,500 pounds  (2,900 kilograms),[10][9]though they continued to grow as they aged and some fantastically ancient specimens might reach 40 feet  (12 meters) in length.[11]They resembled a bizarre eel, with long, tubular bodies, as well as a tail at one end and two fins near the head and another along the back. Aboleths' mouths werelamprey-like, filled with serrated, jawless teeth.[9] Aboleth underbellies were often orange-pink, while their topsides were typically sea-green. A little bit back from the head were four long tentacles, two sprouting from across each other on the top, and two more of the same on the underbelly. Their heads were roughly triangular-shaped, with a spherical, somewhat beak-like nose. Above the nose were their three eyes, each one set atop the other. Tendrils and a few shorter tentacles dangled from the bottom of the head. Four blue-black slime-secreting orifices lined the bottom of their bodies.[9]Aboleth blood was green and thick, oozing like sap.[12] Aboleths breathed through a thick gray mucus-like substance, which covered their body and which they exuded from four pulsating organs along their body as they moved.[10]If robbed of the ability to exude this slime, an aboleth would suffocate in water or on land alike. As such, an aboleth had to take care of its mucus. Out of the water, an aboleth's membrane-like skin dried out quickly, but this did not prove fatal in and of itself. Instead, the aboleth would eventually enter a state of suspended animation, called long dreaming, a fate considered far worse than simply dying amongst aboleths. During this process, the so-hampered aboleth formed a tough, waterproof membrane. However, if this membrane was pierced, liquid flooded out and death was usually not far off for the aboleth.[13] Aboleths did not die of old age and so lived on indefinitely, barring violence or disease.[13]","5e4e3e2e1eVarious depictions of aboleths.Aboleth5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[1]SizeLargeTypeAberrationAlignmentLawful evilChallenge rating104th Edition Statistics[2]SizeLargeOriginaberrantTypeMagical beastKeyword(s)AquaticAlignmentEvil3rd Edition Statistics[3][4]SizeHugeTypeAberrationSubtype(s)Aquatic,psionicAlignmentUsuallylawful evilChallenge rating72nd Edition Statistics[5][6]SizeHugeAlignmentLawful evil1st Edition Statistics[7]SizeLargeAlignmentLawful evilGeneral InformationPatron deityPisaethces(most common aboleths and all savant aboleths)Ghaunadaur/Juiblex(some)[6]MovementSwimming[1][2][3]VisionDarkvision[1][2][3]Homeland(s)Far RealmSea of Fallen StarsUnderdarkIntelligenceHigh[3][5][7]Language(s)Aboleth,Aquan,Deep Speech,[1]Undercommon,Telepathy[1][2][3]Favored terrainUnderground[3]Appearance[3][6]Average length20 ft  (6.1 m)Average weight6,500 lb  (2,900 kg)Eye color(s)RedHistoryFirst appearanceDwellers of the Forbidden CityAboleths(pronounced: /ˈæboʊlɛθ/ÆB-o-leth[8]listen;pl:aboleths[1][3][7]or:aboleth[5]) were a race of malevolent,eel-likeaberrationswith potentpsionicabilities.[9]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Aboleths had powerful psionic powers and were naturalpsionslikemind flayersand many other denizens of theFar Realm.

The skin of the victim was transformed into a membrane that allowed it to breathe in water, and changed the creature's consciousness to that of a mindless servant. This allowed aboleths to keep slaves, known asaboleth servitors, which they dominated and kept captive through their mind. Only the most powerful aboleths could do this, however, completing the process through a powerfulritual.[14] Another strange feature of aboleths was their memory. An aboleth was born with a racial memory, each individual inheriting the memories of its ancestors. Furthermore, it assimilated the memories of those it consumed. Each aboleth's memories were stored within an ever-growing part of its brain that extended down its back as it aged. Aboleths enjoyed spending time lost in particularly fine memories of their ancestors, and if they had nothing better to do, they might relive entire portions of their forebears' lives.[9] Aboleths were all hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female reproductive organs. When aboleths bred, they did so in private, laying roughly one to three eggs once every five years. When laid, the eggs gestated for the same five years before hatching into fully functional aboleths. Although these young aboleths are functionally adults, they typically remained with their parent for roughly a decade, obeying the elder aboleth without question before setting out on their own.[10]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Aboleth society was utterly alien in many ways to that of more familiar races, in part due to the racial memory all aboleths exhibited as well as their generally bizarre psyches.

While they acknowledged the presence and power of gods, they had memories of a time long before any modern gods were worshiped and recalled such gods' birth and often demises within their own lifetimes. They were not concerned with anafterlifesince their perspective on death was to consider it a failure and they intended to live forever. Aboleths did, however, have a certain respect that sometimes approached reverence for the powerful beings known aselder evils.[17] Aboleths used the termboorm(meaning ""flow"") to indicate a period of time.[18]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

If not working or scheming they recklessly indulged in the pleasures and luxuries of the Nine Hells,[3]being among those devils notoriously prone to the temptations of sexual desire.[16]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Due to their own perceived nobility as greater baatezu, amnizus preferred to leave combat to their minions rather than engage attackers themselves.[4]Even when pressed into battle, styx devils favored having a large force of advespas, barbazus, or similarly inferior underlings as a wall between them and their opponents. An amnizu's primary objective was the capture of their foes and so they launched a flurry of fireballs at larger opponents to weaken them as their troops dealt with smaller threats. Once their foes were sufficiently drained an amnizu would attempt to use their mind-draining touch to disable and detain their defeated enemies. If such tactics were not possible, an amnizu's next gambit was to attempt to swoop down at melee opponents and mentally incapacitate them with their touch.[3][17] Amnizus were the baatezu that most frequently studied magic aswizards, often specializing inwatermagic. The psuedo-elementals they conjured from the foul waters of the Styx were greatly feared.[18]","NOT FOUND","Stygia hosted the greatest population of amnizu, with a majority of them residing within the City of Ice, otherwise known asTantlin.[3]Amnizu were sometimes called the Keepers of the Styx, since despite serving other functions within the Nine Hells, their primary purpose was to defend the River of Blood. The Styx was a weak point in Hell's defenses since it ran through both Stygia andAvernus, and thus allowed mortal crusaders andtanar'rihordes access to Hell from other points within theLower Planes.[5][9]While amnizus were technically responsible for keeping invaders out of the Nine Hells, their true task was not so much preventing such beings from entering but to ensure that they never escaped.[5][17] Along every ten miles of the Styx were checkpoints at which every visitor to Hell had to register. Such checkpoints normally consisted of a watchtower from whichwhite abishaiguards could fly in and out of to identify travelers and a processing center where most amnizus dwelt in. Processing centers were grim, odorous places with labyrinthine corridors at the end of which were inquiring amnizu in charge of discerning the motivation, possessions and intended staying time of foreigners. After humiliating strip searches conducted by their guards, travelers were required to pay an entrance fee somewhere below 500 gold pieces worth of coins, magical items or gemstones. Any attempts to break through the bureaucratic net were met by a swiftly organized troupe of hunters that would relentlessly scour the Nine Hells for the rebellious fugitives. Targets would be hunted regardless of boundaries not only for the interrogatory torture an amnizu would be allowed to conduct on prisoners before handing them over tokytons, but for the fame and recognition that came with the deed.[3] The second function of the styx devils was to serve as generals for the infernal legions. Rather than occupying checkpoints along the Styx, some amnizus watched the river from fortresses along its bank from where it flowed throughDisand Stygia.Lemuresthat arrived to Hell through the Styx, having no personality, memories, or desires outside of taking revenge on reality, had to have the rules of Baator drilled into them by amnizu sergeants before they were marshalled into armies.[1]The protection of Stygia depended on amnizu generals, each of which were given an army composed of thousands of abishai and erinyes, although nothing prevented them from using such forces for their own gain.[5]Regardless of personal standing, most amnizu had at least one squadron of advespas at their disposal and a group of barbazus as bodyguards, although they were more fond of havingwar devilsas protectors due to their slightly higher intelligence.[17][19] Amnizus made up the majority of the leaders in the Second Command, the division of the devil legions that specialized in warfare at sea. Their natural resistance to the Styx and greater experience with it made them perfect for the job of protecting and attacking using the wicked waterway. The admirals of the navies often stocked their vessels with an intoxicating flower known as ""desert's night"", a blossom found inSet's stygian realm that could undo the memory loss effects of the Styx.[20]","The touch of an amnizu was incredibly dangerous as it channeled harmful energy into their enemies that only magical protection could impede.[4]Their touch degraded not only the body but the mind, draining targets of their intellects and memories like the Styx itself.[3]Conversely, their connection to the Styx also made them immune to its harmful effects, an immunity that carried over into anything that would reduce their mental capacity.[3][9]Magical, silver, andholyweapons were among the few things that could properly hurt them, outside of acid orgood-aligned spells and abilities.[3][6]In order to banish an amnizu back to Stygia aholy wordhad to be uttered.[4] Due to their role as protectors styx devils were also given access to powerfulimprisonmentmagic with which to seal away dangerous opponents, although they could only make use of it once per day.[4]Amnizus also had an array of powerful and innate, mental magic, letting them dominate and destroy the minds of their opponents.[1]They were also capable of hurling dangerously fastfireballsat their foes as a means of causing more direct harm.[3]If in danger, amnizus could call upon a wide variety of devils for aid, includingabishai,advespas,barbazus,erinyes,hamatulaor another amnizu with varying degrees of success.[3][4][17]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Some were described as lean and quick with long, lanky limbs but others were more akin toogresseswith gnarled muscles and jutting bones comprising their hulking frames.[4][7]Such annis hags, even with their hunched backs and humped shoulders, were still massive,[1]and known to weigh around 325 lb  (147 kg).[2]Their stretched skin was covered in scars and blemishes, and they had a blue-black complexion as if their flesh had been deeply bruised.[7][1] An annis hag's nails were not simply as sharp as blades, but were actually made of iron that magically grew like the keratin nails of normalhumanoids. Normally they were 3 in  (76 mm) long but often stylized by annis hags into long spirals that could inflict unnerving, circular wounds. They were naturally a glossy shade of black but like ordinary steel would oxidize over time, turning their shiny nails into rusted corkscrews.[7]Their sharpened teeth[3]were also metallic and their filthy hair had a similar luster.[2][4]Above an annis's dull, greenish-yellow eyes[5]were a pair of black, upward-arching horns barely longer than a human's thumbs.

By far the most conceited of hags, annis were also the most easily bribed with offers of magic and living prey. The source of their narcissism was their size and strength which to their twisted minds were to be considered virtues. They loved receiving recognition for such traits and so dominated powerful races of humanoid brutes, the stronger the better, who might hold similarly savage mentalities. They were also fiercely territorial, and might tear through entire settlements to destroy even minor threats to their reign.[7] Just as annis hags were eager to subjugate the strong they delighted in dominating the weak, particularly other hags and striking fear into them.[7]Killing was a favorite activity alongside sowing suspicion and confusion and so they left signs of their terrifying activities on the outskirts of their territories.[1][8]Nothing brought an annis more joy than spreading dread and worried anger to a once healthy community, and leaving sinister signs wasn't their only method. One particularly vile tactic was to approach children unseen as kindly crones and slowly warp their sense of morality. What might start as vandalism and wandering off could turn into arson and reckless actions like pushing someone down stairs, until a frightened community was unenviably compelled to punish or exile them.[1]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Those who would dismiss the strength-obsessed annis as simple savages would be making a fatal assumption. Despite being powerful and proud of it, annis hags shunned simple assaults, instead dividing and disorienting their enemies before battle in order to defeat otherwise dangerous opponents.[2][7]Before battle they disguised themselves as commoners to lower their victim's guard[2]or used the mist to sneak up on their targets.[7]They also used the fog clouds to bewilder resisting foes or delay dangerous attacks.[3] In battle, an annis hag favored closing in and grappling, using the unbelievable strength behind their talons and teeth to sink into their victims and continuing to do so until they were dead.[3]The spiraling of their nails was neither a detriment or boon during combat but it was nonetheless disconcerting to see the deep wounds they left.[7]While they might train asbarbariansorfightersthey might also try to improve their natural magical talent assorceresses.[7][8]","NOT FOUND","Unlike most hags, who preferred clever minions rather than stupid goons, annis hags sought to put less intelligent beings under their thumb.[1]Similarly to how they might befriend children, they often adopted ogres,trolls, certain evil giants and other louts, acting as the verbally abusive matron of a potentially racially mixed community.[1][4]They ruled them through brute strength and superstition,[1]gaining information, companionship, security and better food, possibly the giants themselves, for the effort.[4][9]Even if not technically in charge, they sometimes took up the role of the chieftan's wife, ruling from behind the throne rather than atop it.[9] A hag ritual being headed by an annis. It was common both for annis hags to act alone or in coveys,[4]but rarely were their sisters treated with greater care than their other underlings. Annis hags established covens simply by physically overpowering weaker hags and maintained them through fear and force. Such tactics rarely wrung compliance from other annis hags which shared not only the brawn of their kin but the spitefulness and sense of superiority. The extremely rare covens with more than one annis hag were sustained only when the two were constantly wary and conniving towards each other or only had to form them temporarily, although they often ended with bloody backstabbing either way.[7]","The flesh of an annis hag was comparable to leather armor with plate-mail durability, which combined with an annis's magical resistance, made them difficult to assail.[7][4]Cutting and piercing the skin was ineffective but as a result of their brittle bones, bludgeoning them was relatively easy.[8]In terms of offense, annis hags were reliant on their monstrous strength to crush their victims or their iron teeth and claws to rip and rend them.[1][3] Annis hags were unbelievably durable An annis's teeth and nails were also inherently magical, and if pulled out could be fashioned into small, iron tokens such as coins, rings or small mirrors. Afterwards, if within 10 miles of each other, her and the recipient could conduct whispered conversations only they could hear, a useful item for corrupting children. An annis could detect the approximate location of tokens but could only have three active at any one time, although she could near-instantly disable them from any distance and render them magically inert.[1] Aside from her nails, the only inherent magical abilities of annis hags were those of disguise and the power to conjure cold clouds of dense fog.[7]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","With their bruise-blue skin and enigmatic horns, some scholars believed that annis hags were in some way related toogre mages.

Those that suggested such an origin also claimed that the result of the union was the green hags, which bred with ogres and giants to create the magically deficient and shorter-lived annis, with even their language being a degraded version of one unique to night hags.[9]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

If not rewarded the plunder they expected for their services, or if given orders they didn't like, they would desert or even rebel against their employers.[5] Armanites were clannish and territorial demons that forbade any trespassers within their lands.[2]However, though they exercised coordination and discipline admirable by even their hatedbaatezufoes, armanites were in no sense creatures of order.[2]They were disorganized and quarrelsome, brawling amongst each other when no other enemy was available, and they greatly enjoyed the chaotic nature of group combat. They found such conflict far more preferable than individual duels or competitions of skill, and upsetting one was likely to provoke an entire troop.[1][5]They were at their most dangerous when not actively engaged in plotting or conflict, as they were not currently expressing their bloodlust yet and were eager for targets.[6]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","In addition to their natural weapons, many armanites were walking armories, wielding many different weapons kept immaculately clean and covered in Abyssal runes, ranging fromcrossbows,composite bows,shortbows,lances,halberds,sabres,flails,longspears, flangedmaces, and flambergeswords.[6][3][5] Although tactically efficient and able to cooperate, armanites depended on the speed of their stampedes rather than timing or planning. They were efficient as mobile shock troops, striking with stunning speed before retreating and striking again. Their aerial charges especially were effective against foot soldiers, and designed to wreak maximum mayhem and carnage.[5][3] After wading into combat they normally switched from their spears or lances to other melee weapons like flails, wildly kicking and rending their opponents throughout the battle in whirlwinds of destruction.[3]If pressed by sturdier oppositions they attempted to use their lightning abilities to blast their foes apart.[1]","Armanites came into existence either from being born from male and female armanites or ascending from weaker tanar'ri. Female armanites made up a third of the population and the two sexes were segregated as fighting was almost inevitable if they were allowed to mingle amongst themselves. Herds of different genders joined together after a victorious battle against the baatezu, whereupon mating occurred.[5] Young armanites were simply herded along with a camps servants and other followers until they seized a weapon from a deceased troupe member and vanquished their first opponent although many were abandoned and they received no special care. They reached maturity after approximately a year.[6][5]","Armanites were among the most fearsome mercenaries of theBlood War. The 377thlayer of the Abyss, thePlains of Gallenshu, was the dwelling place of most armanites, a series of massive plains constantly tread by huge herds of their kind. The layer was run primarily by the armanites, who functioned in independent companies and were willing to work as guards, scouts, messengers, or otherwise spread mayhem and acquire loot.[8]Most herds of armanites were specialized in specific tasks, like foraging, archery, skirmishing, and other war related skills.[5]They might also equip others for warfare but they never conducted sieges. They had high costs for their services, starting at 100gold piecesa day and only going up from there.[8] All armanite packs were disorderly, but were commanded by a charismatic leader who controlled the group through threats and promises. Most armanites not only served, but worshiped their respective warlords, who often encouraged the formation of these cults.[8]These singular leaders were known asKnechtsor ""Pathwardens"", and often provided ranged support to their packs.[6]The loss of a pack's Knecht resulted in the armanites rampaging until they were stopped or a new Knecht arose.[8]It was much more common to find lone armanites than small groups, as those were almost always the results of failed raids, and with nothing left to fight they often turned upon each other.[6] Sycophants who took the proper initiative had the near-suicidal honor of carrying a herd's standard into battle.[8]Every herd of armanites possessed a troupe banner and a banner of their current warlord, such as a diagonal black-and-white slash forGraz'ztor a golden talon with a dark red background forPazuzu. A troupe banner was a unifying symbol amongst armanites and losing it in battle prompted the same response as losing a Knecht, causing most troupes to feud and disband before either joining forces with one of the lords from thePlain of Infinite Portalsor simply aligning with another troupe.[5] Armanite towns were run by beings known as Konsuls, masters of up to 100 packs. Some Konsuls were capable spellcasters, and rumors had it thatpriestswere also within their midst. Twenty-four towns of the armanites were known in Gallenshu, including: Amber, Basalt, Bloodstone, Bone, Clay, Cold Iron, Dark Spring, Gray Glass, Jade, Mageblood, Maroon, Obsidian, Ochre, Oxblood, Purpure, Silver Spike, and Steelshank. The other seven were run by female armanites, and were small camps of tents, carts, and large, wheeled towers. Mobile towns frequently changed their names while the named ones were stationary.[5]Armanite towns were essentially stables used to regroup, and rearm before engaging in the next big battle.[8] While rebel armanites were normally buried underneath a leafless tree, crippled or weak armanites were put down likehorsesor enslaved. Those slaves that worked as smiths sometimes earned a reputation great enough to earn the attention of significant Abyssal figures, and were taken by these beings for work. This was known as a Bitter Emancipation by both the slaves and former slavemasters, as not only did their herd lose a capable craftsman, but the slave might end up getting turned into amaneif they failed to produce amazing works. Outside of weapons they were also known for being excellent farriers, making outstanding and sometimes magicalhorseshoes, and some of the best yokes and harnesses in all the planes, Puffed and slashed cloaks, colorful flags, and battle standards were also well-made pieces.[8] Armanites often worked as special operatives fordemon lordsdue to their excellence when working in independent packs. Territory andsoul larvaewere also acceptable methods of payment from their Abyssal masters.[2]The denizens of theUpper Planesreferred to them as Dark Horsemen or Darkriders and feared their presence, and they were also hired to serve as bodyguards withinSigil.[5]","Armanites were practically living weapons with their sharp hooves, talons, and tails allowing them to rip their foes to pieces with ease.[1]Outside of their natural weaponry, more powerful armanites could let loose lances of lightning against their enemies.[1][5] Armanites could also fly by galloping into the air for a maximum of one hour a day. They began flying slowly into the air, seemingly running up an invisible hill, and could not stop or quickly change directions while they did so.[5]If the need arose, armanites could summon a small crowd ofdretchesor another armanite to their aid.[3]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","The first armanites were from six clans ofFeywildcentaurs that had been enslaved and twisted byfomoriansbefore escaping and stumbling upon a portal toPazunia. After time spent in the realm of demons some turned into demons themselves, abandoning their proud heritage in favor of becoming abyssal mercenaries.[2] During one of the hotter points of theBlood War, many armanites worked with the similarly blood-crazed bulezaus ofBaphomet, and their combined assaults were core to the defeat ofHell's legions. When the equally violent demons attempted to claim the spoils of war, conflict broke out on who would take what. The grudges from these battles are still seen in the inability of both demons to cooperate.[2]Although some armanites within Gallenshu still worshiped Baphomet,[8]many switched to serve under demons likeDemogorgonorKostchtchie, with bands who worked with the Horned King being rare and usually doing so briefly.[2] During theFiend Warsof theYear of the Twisted Horn, 729 DR, a troop of armanites fought in theScaled Hordeunder thehalf-fiendBerdrinnar.[9]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

This way they could be free to indulge themselves by tormenting weaker foes.[6]One of their preferred tactics was to abduct enemies off the battlefield, teleporting them somewhere else to be dealt with later.[2] In warfare, babau gangs could make excellent strike teams and were typically sent to on raids or assassination missions targeting obvious champions or leaders. They could teleport to their destination and wreak havoc before disappearing again, or failing this approach undetected by more conventional methods. They always tried to make the best use of their terrain and allies, repositioning themselves to exploit weaknesses in the enemy.[9]","NOT FOUND","The deviousness of babaus was a trait valued by nearly every demon lord within the Abyss, with almost every one having a small gang of babaus to serve as secret agents. Espionage, sabotage, and assassination were all common tasks for them, with their cunning stratagems compensating for their relative weakness and deceptiveness.[2] However they also served another role within the Abyss, roaming the layers to find low level tanar'ri to draft into theBlood War. Babaus corralled other demons together in exchange for their own relative freedom, and failing to fill the ranks with other demons would require the babau in question to fill it themselves.[8]Because of their integral position in the Blood War, demons more powerful than them occasionally provided them with assistance, less out of loyalty than in order to further their duties.[4]Having superior demons possibly arrive to watch over them was as terrifying to their assailants as it was to the babaus.[8] Within the Abyss they had a complex relationship with the various other types of demons. They would sometimes work withsuccubiwho had a similar deceptive streak and be paired withvrockswhen on the battlefield.[2][6]However because of their roles as recruiters, vrocks,hezrousandglabrezusas well as several other lesser demons hated them and ganged up on them in order to escape service.[4]Nalfeshneesin particular feared and loathed babaus in great numbers, a feeling shared by the babaus, who had a taste for nalfeshnee flesh.[5]","The acidic ooze that covered a babau made it incredibly hard to damage for two reasons. Weapons and flesh that made contact with the slime were corroded, and its oiliness caused more sharp, precise weapons to slide off.[4][5]Their eyes could produce an effect similar to a ray of enfeeblement, sapping the strength from any nearby target.[1]Adding to their supernatural repertoire was their array of magical spell-like abilities includingdarkness,dispel magic,fear,heat metal, andlevitate.[1]Although normal attempts to gate in tanar'ri normally resulted in a fewcambionsor another babau it was possible that a more powerful demon would heed their cry for help.[4]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Discretion and wariness were rarities in the Abyss, and the origin of demons that specialized in it came down to two of the most deceptivearchfiendsknown to the planes.

In an unexpected turn of events, Graz'zt not only survived, but his blood splatters animated, became the first babaus and helped to rout Glasya.

However, this was limited in its scope as they were incapable of creating objects with moving parts or magical properties. Furthermore, balhannoths could only affect nonliving objects and close inspection of objects within a warped area would reveal them to be facsimiles.[5] Balhannoths were capable of telepathically reading other creatures minds. They would use this ability to reach out towards any intelligent creatures that got within 1 mile of their lairs and learning whatever it was they desired most. Those that did would begin feeling as though they were close to that desire and this feeling would grow stronger as they got closer to its lair.[1]They would then use their reality warping abilities to make their lair resemble what the creature desired.[5] Once it lured a creature within its lair a balhannoth would grapple and teleport them anywhere within 60 feet  (18 meters) to begin their attack in earnest.[1]Though if a balhannoth was not yet ready to go on the offensive, they were capable of turning invisible,[1]altering their skin so that it blended in with their environment.[4]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Despite their overwhelming power, many balors favored scheming and plotting rather than doing battle on the front lines. They preferred to battle from afar using their spells, abilities, and ranged weapons, utilizing their incredible flying speed and teleportation skills to navigate the battlefield with ease.[3][10] Balors nevertheless enjoyed battle.[3]If forced to fight in close range, they used their flaming whips to entangle and force a target into range of the potent flames they constantly emitted or their powerfulvorpalswords, with which they could either heavily wound or finish off their targets.[3][2][1] Balors typically began battle by enveloping themselves in theirunholy aurasand using their most powerful spells from the start in order to quickly take control of the fight, summoning additional demons if needed to overrun their enemies. After doing so, it would stay out of range while using its remaining spells to weaken or kill the remaining foes. However, if feeling unthreatened, they would typically use nonlethal attacks and spells while saving their strength, focusing on capturing or disabling their victims.[3]When fighting head on, balors focused incessantly on one opponent at a time.[2]","NOT FOUND","An engraving of a balor. While many believed that there were only twenty-four balors within theAbyss, this was merely the number that were known at one point.[7][8]Rather than stay within specific areas, most balors roamed the Abyss gathering soldiers to create their armies, giving them commands in their battles against the baatezu.[4]Typically a tanar'ri horde was lead by a marilith, with balors commanding multiple hordes in larger battles.[11] Balors were the very heart of the Blood War, their wrathful devotion an awesome inspiration that roused furious bloodlust in their inferiors, a display that the logical moves of the mariliths couldn't hope to match.[9]Because they were among the most important demons in regards to the Blood War, the balors could be said to be part of the Abyss's immune system against Hell,[4]ironically causing them to lean towards organized evil.[5] Their relationship with other demons was complicated due to the position and views of the balors.Glabrezuswere favored by balors due to their corrupting influence and use of temptation against mortals. Mariliths andnalfeshneesviewed the balors as unnecessary figures only in command due to their power, and that their greater intelligence and tactical skills were superior. Nalfeshnees in particular would take every opportunity to undermine the Blood War and embarrass their balor masters rather than directly challenge their authority.[12]In general, balors were dreaded beings who preferred to be around creatures just short of their own power rather than weaklings or equals. While two balors might occasionally team up, any alliance would normally break after some time had passed due to their natural competitiveness.[2] On the other hand, beings more powerful than the balor did exist, such as themolydeiandklurichirs. The former, despite reporting to the balors, worked for their respective demon lords above all else and would not hesitate to report a rebellious balor.[13]Klurichirs were significantly stronger than balors and might casually beat them if they stepped out of line or committed a perceived act of laziness.[14]Demon lords in particular did not favor balors as servants due to their malevolent force of personality and ability to unite demons to their will, hence the molydei to help keep them in line.[4][5]","Balors were beings of flame and cinders, constantly exuding fire too hot for most to bear, being immune to fire themselves, and exploding into a lurid flash of light that destroyed everything nearby upon death. Their flaming whips had tails ending in hooks, spikes, and balls, allowing them to easily draw in those netted by them. Balors were able to summon hordes ofdretches, other weak demons, or smaller numbers of more powerful tanar'ri.[3][2] As tanar'ri, they were resistant to most forms of energy, specifically being immune toelectricityandpoison, while resistant tocoldandacid. This combined with their tough exterior and magic resistance, made them incredibly hard to kill in combat.[3] The magical capabilities of the balor were largely based around controlling the battlefield while destroying those in its path with devastating strength. Their magic allowed them todominatepowerful beings; drive creatures intoinsanity, which could only be stopped with powerful magic;instantly paralyze, weaken, or kill any non-evil creature in its presence; or weave greatfire stormsfrom nothing. Their most powerful ability. however, was to cause creatures it focused on toimplode, instantly killing them.[3] The few who were particularly ambitious could further increase their power through training, with some of them deciding to properly learnwizardrywhich always had devastating results. As one of the most magically gifted out of all tanar'ri within the Abyss, they were capable of reaching the heights of magic, usually picking straightforwardschools of magicsuch asevocation.

"banderhobb","Banderhobbs were humongous creatures that superficially resembled giant bipedaltoads. Scrawny sets of limbs ending in long keen claws strangely contrasted with their otherwiseogre-sized frames.[1]Within the depths of their massive maws was a serpentine tongue along with two rows of saw-like fangs. Atop their amphibian-like heads was a pair of huge, bulbous eyes that appeared blank and empty.[3] Some banderhobbs lacked the immense size of their kin, being lithe and short where others were stout and tall. Their feet were normally flapping and flat, as they silently moved through the darkness. Other reported traits of the banderhobbs were inconsistent and variable, although it was fully possible that all of them were true.[3] Some banderhobbs were rumored to have extra-dimensional caverns within their stomachs. Reports of those who had been swallowed, stated they were taken to a strange room much larger than the creature. Within the depths of the stomach was a giant face, taking up about half the surface area of the room, with a hole in the middle leading to the true stomach. The ghastly outline was not a true face as it lacked eyes and was distorted, elongated, and a ghastly-white that contrasted with the rest of their flesh-colored insides.[3] After being swallowed by a banderhobb, it was possible to carve a path out of them from the inside, but it had to be done quickly before digestion was completed.[3]","5e4eVarious depictions of banderhobbs.Banderhobb5e4e5th Edition Statistics[1]TypeMonstrosityAlignmentNeutral evilChallenge rating54th Edition Statistics[2]SizeStandardLargeFilchSmallOriginShadowTypeMagical beastAlignmentEvilGeneral InformationVisionDarkvision120 ft (37 m)Homeland(s)ShadowfellLanguage(s)UnderstandsCommon,Goblin, and the languages of its creator, but can't speakBanderhobbswere enigmatic monsters of shadow and flesh that seemingly hailed from theShadowfell.[1]They were known for capturing targets at random, by appearing from the shadows as they slept and stealing them away.[3]","While most of the malevolent forces of the Shadowfell were driven by dark emotions such as hatred, jealousy, spite, or sheer ego, banderhobbs held no such feelings. At the same time, no action they committed was based in kindness, respect, or adoration. Emotions were an alien concept to the banderhobb mind and even urges like hunger and sleep were not things they desired to do but processes they recognized they had to undergo.[3] The truly terrifying aspect of the banderhobbs was that they were completely apathetic to their situation, striving only to complete the missions assigned to them. They could not be driven to acts of anger, frightened away, or made to feel sorrow, nor did they make challenges or waste time gloating. Entirely subservient to whatever nebulous entity commanded them, banderhobbs were practically impossible to manipulate. They had no personal compulsions, completed their mission even if it inevitably ended in their own death, and kept their assigned goals so well hidden that they could not be used against them.[3] Assuming that banderhobbs were unthinking soldiers, however, was a grave mistake that only benefited the monsters. The absolute obedience often mistaken for mindlessness allowed a banderhobb to make completely logical assessments without impulse or emotion impeding its thinking. Both cunning and incredibly aware, a banderhobb could make swift tactical decisions and even decide to retreat if it believed that it was the most efficient path to completing its task. Despite their inability to verbally communicate, they could receive commands to an intriguingly deep degree. Unlike automatons they were capable of recognizing idioms, metaphors, dialects, and otherwise reading into the non-literal meaning of commands, with individuals being able to better comprehend different tongues.[3]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Banderhobbs exited portals from their realms alone or in pairs, but the exact numbers varied based on the scale of the invasion. They maintained an orderly march through areas of thin shadows, and when returning with their quarry, allowed the carrier to pass first while the others remained to clean up anyone who heard of their escapades. Those who heard anything about them were eliminated within the next year, and anyone who leaked their secrets was practically doomed to be stolen away.[3]shadow wolvesandhowlerswere the only entities they were known to collaborate with when pulling off their kidnappings.[2] There also existed a ritual to conjure a banderhobb through a combination of flesh and shadow.Hagswere chiefly in possession of this knowledge but other darkfey, greatfiends, and corrupt mortalwizardsknew the secrets to such a process.[1] Once a banderhobb completed their mission, they would expire, leaving behind only shadowy wisps and tar-like slime.[1]Without their masters having some other plan for their captives, it  was often thought that the banderhobbs simply consumed their victims, although they may have been a process to create more of their kind.[3]","Great strength lay hidden within the seemingly scrawny arms of the banderhobb, with bone-crushing claws capable of squeezing the life out of the most physically capable mortals. Their tongues were controlled by a plethora of muscles, faster than a coiled snake, and with a grip tighter than a giant python.[3]Masterfully manipulating their tongues, they could quickly wrap their victims up and drag them towards their gaping maws. Within their gullets laid the bodies of whoever they had consumed, possibly still alive, as well as weapons, clothes, or anything they had been instructed to steal.[1] One known process by which they found their targets was by being provided with some part of their body like hair or blood, or a piece of something they carried, like clothing.

While not necessarily as tough as afighter, as skilled as arogue, or as intelligent as awizard, bards were widely capable in a number of different situations and were widely recognized as a sort of ""jack-of-all-trades.""[18]For instance, bards were better trained in weaponry than all other arcane spellcasters (includingswordmages) trained in the use of all simple weapons,longswords,rapiers,shortswords, and hand crossbows.[19]Additionally, some bards exhibited proficiency inscimitarsand martial ranged weapons as well.[20]Similarly, bards were naturally knowledgeable and had an uncanny ability for improvisation and trying new things. But unlike fighters or rogues, who might be similarly proficient, bards were capable of castingritualsandspells, including those normally only used by other spellcasters.[21] Bards of all kinds learned to inspire virtue and ability in those around them. Exactly how frequently a bard could do this depended partially upon their strength of personality as well as their level of experience.[21]Some bards used their inspirational power to boost their allies' cunning or reflexes, while others inspired and furthered the courage and valor in those with whom they fought.[22]In addition to this, experienced bards could also counteract the effects of spells designed to charm or frighten, providing magical aid to their allies.[18]Similarly, bards, through their music and arts, could soothe the nerves of their allies and, through their magic, heal their wounds and bolster their spirits, either at rest or in combat.[22] Bards were, as a general rule, uncannily skilled advocates and diplomats. For many bards this was a result of their typically high charisma but some bards - including those who were less charming - could boost their persuasive power through magic. They did this by actually enchanting the very words they speak, making them sound even more persuasive and compelling than they would normally.[22] Like other spellcasters, bards usually used implements to increase the effectiveness of their spells[15]or to subsitute for their material cost.[23]Some bards usedwandsfor this purpose, wielding them like a conductor's baton. Others use more specialized implements such assongblades.[15]Most however used amusical instrument, enchanted or mundane, focusing their magic through music.[19]Many bards particularly treasured this latter method[15]and believed their music tapped into theWords of Creationthemselves, sprinkling song and story with echoes of the universe's beginnings.[9]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"
"barghest","The true form of the barghests resembledgoblin–wolfhybrids with monstrous jaws and razor sharp claws.[3]They were able to shapeshift into either a goblin or canine form, each of which were indistinguishable from normal members of their kind to most.[5]Goblins immediately recognized barghests in their goblin forms and no matter the canine form they assumed, whetherwar dog,wild dogor wolf, other canines could easily identify them.[4]A hateful, orange glow was given off by their intelligent eyes when they were excited and they occasionally possessed unusual traits that betrayed their true nature, such as a shock of white hair or a discolored eye.[2][3] Barghest whelps naturally appeared as larger, yellow-skinned goblins, eventually developing the ability to take on the form of a large wolf with powerful claws, their true form as this stage. As barghests matured, their forms grew to about 6 feet  (1.8 meters) long, weighed 180 pounds  (82 kilograms), and their yellow skin darkened to a shade of bluish-red until eventually turning entirely blue.[1][3][4]Barghests that achieved greater status could transform into 8 feet  (2.4 meters) tall, 400 pounds  (180 kilograms), goblin-like monsters or intodire wolves.[3]On incredibly rare occasions, barghests could grow to such gargantuan proportions that they could occupy small mountains.[9]Other goblinoid races like thebugbearsorhobgoblinswere known to have barghest versions of their kind.[2]","5e4e3e2eVarious depictions of barghestsBarghest5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[1]SizeLargeTypeFiendTag(s)ShapechangerAlignmentNeutral evilChallenge rating44th Edition Statistics[2]SizeMediumOriginNaturalTypeHumanoidKeyword(s)ShapechangerAlignmentEvil3rd Edition Statistics[3]SizeMediumTypeOutsiderSubtype(s)Evil,lawful,shapechangerAlignmentAlwayslawful evilChallenge rating42nd Edition Statistics[4]SizeMedium to largeAlignmentLawful evil1st Edition Statistics[5]SizeMedium to LargeAlignmentEvil(lawfultendency)General InformationVisionBlindsight,Darkvision[1]Homeland(s)Gehenna[3]Language(s)Abyssal,Common,Goblin,Infernal,Telepathy,[1]Worg[3]AppearanceAverage height5‒9 ft (1.5‒2.7 m)[4]Average length6 ft  (180 cm)[3]Average weight180 lb  (82 kg)[3]Hair color(s)Bluish-red to blue[3]Eye color(s)Orange when glowing[3]HistoryFirst appearanceDragon#26Based onBarghest(English)Barghests(pronounced: /bɑːrˈgɛst/bar-GEST[6]listen) werefiendishlupine shapeshifters and the only true natives ofGehenna.[3][7]They commandedgoblinoidsand consumed mortal souls to gain power and return to the Fourfold Furnaces.[4]","Barghests were treacherous tyrants that craved power over others, ruling goblinoids through fear and force.[2]During their time in theMaterial Planethey grew not only physically but mentally, learning the skills and strategies needed to lead and hunt in the much harsher and competitive Gehenna.[4]Bugbear barghests often attempted to incite other goblinoids into committing acts of violence against others while hobgoblin barghests commanded the terrified respect of their underlings and enemies.[2]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Driven by their instinctual bloodlust and primal hunger for the life essence of mortals, barghests preferred to tear into foes with their natural armaments rather than using manufactured weapons. They had a tendency to unconsciously drop such weapons on the ground but were rational enough to overpower their bestial urges if given sufficient reason. The advantage provided by enchanted weapons was often enough to compel greater barghests to use them, but barghests would also use weapons if doing so furthered a scheme somehow.[3][10] Despite their murderous intent and savage impulses, barghests were ambush predators that rarely confronted foes under equal terms. After disguising their numbers and positions, they magically manipulated enemy emotions to disorient them. When in packs, barghests ganged up on as few opponents as possible at the same time, using their speed to avoid powerful enemies.[3][12] Unlike the silently stalking bugbears, barghest savagers leaped boldly into battle and looked for useful targets to drain. On the other hand, hobgoblin barghests allowed enemies to come to them, waiting for as many foes to draw close as possible before absorbing the group's life force and backing away when attacked.[2]","NOT FOUND","Barghests on the Material Plane operated either alone or with a sibling, lurking in remote humanoid communities or joining bands of goblinoids although they weren't opposed to leading other wicked races.[2][4]Normally they attempted to keep their true nature hidden for as long as possible, devouring the occasional goblin when given the opportunity until old enough to find more promising prey and too obvious remain inconspicuous. Goblins sycophantically worshiped barghests, each pathetically trying to demonstrate its worth to its host in order to avoid the ire and hunger of their new masters. Barghests typically retained their goblinoid forms when leading such tribes, existing in a strange and cruel symbiosis with their goblin host.[1][4][13]So long as the goblins could please the barghest with gifts and sacrifices the barghests would protect the tribe from threats and bolster their hoards, with bugbear barghests in particular leading murderous raids on villages.[2][4]Barghests earned greater acclaim and status in Gehenna when they consumed great goblinoid leaders and other powerful souls, making them the primary targets of their voracity.[1][4] Barghests on Gehenna tried to isolate themselves from each other, seeking out their own reeking valley rifts to act as their strongholds and amassing their own servant collections. Unlike on the Material Plane, barghests on their native plane collected personal treasure hoards of unknown value and composition.[4]They attempted to forge small fiefdoms of slaves in order to wage war on their rivals, typically other barghests, and young barghests were sent to the Material Plane in an attempt by the elders of the race to both safely raise their children and stay in power.[14][7]If a barghest was sent back to Gehenna before eating enough souls to return on its own they were likely to be killed or enslaved, whether by ayugolothor its kin, for its weakness, at the very least requiring assistance to return.[1][4]Despite their attempts to remain solitary, barghests swarmed acrossKhalasand could only be found in smaller numbers on the lower levels of Gehenna.[14][7] Narzugonshad been known to ride greater barghests as opposed tonightmaresand their ability to shapeshift into canines had earned them the misnomer of ""devil-dogs"".[15][5]","Barghests had numerous spell-like abilities at their disposal, such aslevitate,pass without trace,dimension door,charm person, and numerous illusion and enchantment powers.[1][3][4][5]Greater barghests had access to group spells such asinvisibility sphere,massbull's strength, andmassenlarge.[3] They could take on either their true forms, goblinoid forms or canine forms in a matter of seconds although their equipment was left behind. Their goblinoid forms were generally deprived of natural weapons but could don armor and handle tools.[3]Some were also capable of taking on other humanoid shapes, such as those ofdrow, but would keep their bestial strength even in more lithe forms. Their wolf form was faster and stealthier than their true form and able to usepass without tracemuch quicker, but lacked much of their spellcasting, and the claws of their true form.[3][10]Canines were immediately driven to fear and hate barghests in their wolf forms, attacking them whenever feasible.[5] Although enchanted weapons were required to seriously harm a barghest, they possessed a number of glaring weaknesses.Holy waterwas a viable weapon against them and barghests that had not reached greater status could be affected by fiend-targeting powers likeprotection from evilor the turning powers of someclerics.[11]Ironically, the fiends were most threatened by open flames, as infernos larger than their bodies, either 10 feet tall or wide, could immediately return them to Gehenna. They could attempt to resist the draw of their home plane and normally could not be banished by explosions or bursts of fire like from the breath of ared dragonor afireballspell.[1]When in canine form however, barghests suddenly enveloped by magical flame were just as likely to be sent back to the Fourfold Furnaces as they were under normal conditions.[5]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Goblinoid parents believed that barghests were blessings fromBane, who at one point had conquered the goblinoid pantheon, but the creatures possessed another origin story.[2]Long ago,Maglubiyethad petitioned the General of Gehenna for yugoloth mercenaries but betrayed their deal. This prompted the General to create the barghests, which would devour the souls of important goblinoids and deprive Maglubiyet of useful troops and leaders. It was said that all barghests desired to return to Gehenna in order to join the General's legions and that they had to eat seventeen goblinoid souls to do so, a number corresponding to the amount of oaths that Maglubiyet supposedly broke.[1] A barghest namedUlgululived out his early years around the region ofSundabarand became very strong after many such consumptions, so strong in fact as to be near able to return toGehenna.[13]In theYear of the Gate, 1341 DR,[16]he slew a farming family called theThistledownsand devoured their eldest daughter. In the process, he left false evidence to point the blame at the drowrangerDrizzt Do'Urdenso as to cover his crimes.[10]In revenge for the slain family, the dark elf killed Ulgulu, along with the creature's minions and brotherKempfana. Ulgulu died halfway between changing back from the form of a gigantic wolf, proving the barghest's ability to shape change.[17] Although typically lacking the magical power needed to createwarlocks, a barghest known asTarkomanghad taken up residence in theMines of Tethymarand made his own out of the previous worghest, and occasionally martial goblin, inhabitants. His immense size required his servants to hollow out a nearby mountain for him to dwell in and he had a gargantuan appetite to match his proportions. Whether or not he had a grand scheme in mind, unending hunger and army of followers made him a threat to the entireDesertmouth Mountainregion.[9] CircaYear of the Shield, 1367 DR, a barghest took to terrorizing travelers ofDaggerdale.

However, protective magic items still worn by the statue would continue to affect it as they would if the victim was still flesh and blood.[12]Creatures petrified by a basilisk were not dead, but placed into a form of permanent suspended animation some called ""stone sleep"". While petrified, the statue could be damaged, just as natural stone could be.[12] A basilisk's eyes were also capable of viewing theastralandetherealplanes, though not at the same time, and only if they concentrated to do so. Their gaze also worked against creatures on these planes, killing creatures on the astral, and turning those on the ethereal into a different kind of ""ethereal"" stone.[12]On the material plane, they could see both the infrared, and ultraviolet spectrums of light, granting themdarkvision.[12] A basilisk attacking a target. Given a higher-than-average food supply, a basilisk could regrow lost limbs and tails within one to four months.[11]","Basilisks had a very slow metabolism, making their movements sluggish and clumsy. As a result, basilisks relied upon their powerful magical characteristics for hunting and were unprepared for a hard pursuit. As a result, prey that fled usually got away unharmed. To prevent this, basilisks typically laired in hidden dens, waiting for any prey unfortunate enough to wander in, even if it was extremely small. Basilisks had a very robust digestive system, however, and could digest even stone. When not hunting, basilisks slept off their meals in their lairs, sometimes in small groups of up to six individuals.[3] Basilisks were lazy and cowardly creatures, but evilly cunning. They made their lairs in dark underground caves where there was a ready and easily accessible food and water supply. They were easy to anger, though they never fought to the death if it could be helped. They were observed to be irrational and possibly insane half the time but shrewd hunters the other half. When hunting, they pounced from hiding and attacked with their petrifying gaze and vicious bite. They only needed to eat one large meal (the size of a deer or a humanoid) a month, owing to their slow metabolisms, though would apparently gorge themselves to death if provided with enough meat.[9] Basilisks spent much of their time asleep basking, either in the heat of the sun, or, if that was too harsh, in the heat of some other source, such as a volcanic vent, or even a campfire. If the basilisk was unable to warm itself for more than a day, it would become sluggish, ultimately dying of hypothermia after a further three days.[11] Though thought by many to be incapable of eating a petrified victim,[12]at least after infancy (immature basilisks had been observed by scholars devouring chunks of statues, but not adults),[9]all basilisks were in fact capable of eating their petrified prey due to their strong jaws and a process within their gullet that transformed the stone back into flesh.[1] When angered, they hissed like a cobra.[9]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Their scales were colored in variations of dark blue and were lighter on the behir's undersides.[3][4] They had long narrow heads,[6]crocodilianin shape,[4]with curved, black horns on the top[6][3]that were used for preening.[3][4]Behirs hatched lacking horns.[8]Their mouths were full of many sharp multi-colored translucent teeth that were valued for theirgem-like beauty,[6][9]and their bones were crystalline.[10] Newly hatched behirs were about 2 feet  (0.61 meters) in length,[4]while the typical adult behir was around 40 feet  (12 meters) long[3][4]and weighed about 4,000 pounds  (1,800 kilograms).[3]Behirs reached adulthood at the age of ten and, like other reptilian creatures, would continue to grow throughout their lifetimes, shedding their scales periodically in the process.[6]Because of this, behirs could sometimes reach gargantuan sizes.[3]","5eR5e4e3e2e1eDepictions of the common behir.Behir5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[1]SizeHugeTypeMonstrosityAlignmentNeutral evilChallenge rating114th Edition Statistics[2]SizeHugeOriginNaturalTypeMagical beastAlignmentUnaligned3rd Edition Statistics[3]SizeHugeTypeMagical beastAlignmentOftenneutralChallenge rating82nd Edition Statistics[4]SizeGargantuanAlignmentNeutral evil1st Edition Statistics[5]SizeLargeAlignmentNeutral evilGeneral Information[4]MovementClimbing[3]VisionDarkvision[3]Low-light vision[3]Activity cycleDay[4]DietCarnivoreAverage lifespan50‒60 years[6]Language(s)Common[3],Draconic[1]SubracesHalruaan behirFavored climateAnyFavored terrainAny landAppearanceAverage length40 ft  (12 m)[3][4]Average weight4,000 lb  (1,800 kg)[3]Skin color(s)Deep blue to ultramarine with gray-brown bands[3][4]DistinctionsSerpentine body[3][4]Twelve legs[3][4]HistoryFirst appearanceThe Lost Caverns of TsojcanthBased onBeithirAbehir(pronounced: /bɛˈhɪər/be-HEER[7]listen;pl:behir[4][5]or:behirs[1][3]) was a great serpentine monster with twelve legs and electrical breath.[3][4]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","If a behir grabbed ahold of an opponent or prey with its mouth, it had several options.

"beholder","Beholders were immediately identifiable, being essentially a floating head with one single,cyclops-like eye surrounded by ten smaller eye stalks. Other than this, the main feature of a beholder's anatomy was its massive, gaping maw. Because of these features, beholders were occasionally known as ""spheres of many eyes"" or ""eye tyrants,""[7]although the latter also referred to a specific type of beholder.[2] Beholders of the Realms tended to be slightly larger than beholders found on other worlds, growing up to six feet in diameter where on other worlds they would average five feet wide. The majority of beholders living on Faerûn had skin colored in cool colors—purples and blues—on the top of their bodies that graduated into earth tones further down. Said skin had a pebbly texture. Most of Toril's beholders had nostrils and jointed, articulated eyestalks.[9] Because their entire body was covered in eyes, beholders had the capacity to see in all directions at once, making it nearly impossible to ambush them while also giving them an unusually high degree of perceptive ability. Although beholders lacked the capacity to see color, they had the ability to perceive even in the most darkened environment, under conditions in which ahumanor similar creature would be rendered completely blind.[7] Beholders were also capable of flight, in spite of their lack of wings or similar physical features, simply hovering above ground effortlessly. The effects of this flight resembled those of thewizardspelllevitation.[7]","5e4e3e2e1eSeveral depictions of beholders.Beholder5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[1]SizeLargeTypeAberrationAlignmentLawful evilChallenge rating13in lair144th Edition Statistics[2]SizeLargeOriginAberrantTypeMagical beastAlignmentEvil3rd Edition Statistics[3]SizeLargeTypeAberrationAlignmentUsuallylawful evilChallenge rating132nd Edition Statistics[4]SizeMedium to HugeAlignmentLawful evil1st Edition Statistics[5]SizeLargeAlignmentLawful evilGeneral InformationMovementFlying[1][3][4]VisionDarkvision (360 degrees)[1]Homeland(s)UnderdarkLanguage(s)Beholder,[3]Undercommon,[1][3]Deep Speech[1]Favored climateCold[3]Favored terrainAny space,[6]Hills[3]AppearanceAverage length8 ft (2.4 m) diameterDistinctionsEye raysCharm MonsterFlightHistoryFirst appearanceMonster Manual1steditionAbeholder, sometimes called asphere of many eyesor aneye tyrant, was a largeaberrationnormally found in theUnderdark.

Powerful and intelligent, beholders were among the greatest threats to the world.[7]","A beholder observing some petrified adventurers. Xenophobic and vicious creatures, beholders were quick to attack enemies, including anyone they deemed not ""like themselves."" Beholders, as a rule, were violent and greedy, hungering for both wealth and power over others. This was made all the more complicated since more than one variety of beholder existed, each believing itself to be the pinnacle of bodily perfection and they viewed other beholders who differed from this image in even the most minute details as loathsome enemies and inferiors.[7] Beholder minds were divided into two separate entities. Each of these entities thought and acted on its own accord even though it was bound to the same body as the other half of its mind. Neither half of the beholder's mind trusted the other, so they hid a lot from each other, creating a very paranoid relationship. ""Sane beholders"" were beholders whose minds were not ""divided"" so to speak. They were still two entities within the beholder, but neither hid anything from the other, making a less paranoid beholder. However, the persona of a ""sane"" beholder was just as likely to be considered insane by any non-beholder. Because there were two entities within a single beholder, that beholder should always be addressed by its full name when in conversation with them, or they would perceive it as speaking to only one of the entities.[29] A beholder, and its antimagic cone.","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Beholders were not particularly strong but were inherently magical creatures, with each of their eyes possessing an innately magical nature. Beholders, who often attacked for seemingly no reason, would often try to end a battle as quickly as possible, unleashing their terrifying abilities all at once. Among the most basic of these attacks was their deadly ability to project magical power from their eyes, in varying forms such as instilling fear within, charming, knocking out, petrifying, disintegrating, slowing, or killing their enemies.[7]Any combination of these was possible, although they often used only two at a given time.[2] Many, but not all, beholders also had the capacity to use their central eye to project a field ofantimagic, which canceled the effects of all supernatural abilities within a small cone of 150 feet in length. In addition to enemyspells,prayers, or similar effects, this also affected a beholder's own eye rays, suppressing their power. However, the inability to cast its eye rays at full strength was hardly a hindrance—it allowed a beholder to attack its foes with its large, toothy maw.[7]","A very irate beholder.

However, as the beholders began visiting other spheres, the local deities grew fearful of their purpose and placed a number ofcursesupon the entire species. As a result, the beholders forgot their original purpose and degenerated into the supremacist and paranoid creatures they would become best known for.[17] It was believed that the knowledge station at the summit of theSpindleon the planetH'Cathahad been placed there by the beholder deities, so beholders could be reminded of their original mission.[53]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Using their mastery of cold weather, they spread misery and despair to communities during winter seasons with the intent to create enough desperation to instill a miserly mindset in the populace.[1] The pitiful attempts of unprepared mortals to survive, such as eatingleatherin place of actual food; their suffering and the suffering they brought to others, such as by murdering people or defiling the sacred for resources; and their eventual deaths were all delightful to a bheur. The sweetest part of such times for bheur hags was when selfish acts were committed unnecessarily, such as when individuals hoarded more resources than they could possibly use while those lacking died around them,[1]and the conniving crones loved planting such avaricious ideas.[1][5] Bheurs themselves had great knowledge of nature and substantial survival skills.[1][3]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","A bheur's first move in combat was often to use a spell, like cone of cold, able to affect multiple foes at once in order to evaluate their opponents' defense against cold. Those that seemed vulnerable were blasted by similar attacks, while those who seemed to resist were cursed. Those who were immune were subjected to spells like ice storm that inflicted other forms of damage, or simple melee attacks.[5][3]The consumption of their enemies was generally performed once the hag was fully in the throes of battle.[1] Still, bheur hags were intelligent and concerned with their own survival, and so usually fled when confronted with dangerous enemies. Instead, blue hags would ambush such enemies using the environmental advantage of their local terrain, especially when dealing with enemies that proved dangerous in the past.[5][3]Spellcasters possessing electric or acidic spells in particular were threats that bheurs were hesitant to confront. They preferred to attack lone travelers,[4]create restraining permafrost, and lure enemies into unavoidable deadfalls and dangerous snowdrifts.[5]","","Despite beingchaoticcrones with deadly magic, the rightfully feared bheurs were occasionally sought out for their wisdom or prophecies.[5]They were usually lone wanderers,[3]having little to no space for community or kinship in their cold hearts.[1]Nevertheless, they were sometimes accompanied by mounted icearchonsoravarielguards,[5]or found working withorglashesto deceive and devour others.[3]","Bheur hags had magical control over the cold; their touch inflicted raw frost that was especially painful to beings of fire, and they could blast their enemies aside with rime.[5][4]They could createcones of coldand were known to create chains of permafrost, and could curse even those normally resistant to the cold to suffer from its effects.[5]They were often surrounded by snow and wind, and moved unhampered by icy terrain and unseen through bitter blizzards.[1][5] Bheurs were powerful, but had a weakness in the form of their staves. While not magical in itself, a hag'sgraystaff— also called astaff of frost —served as a foci to help unleash the bheur's inner power, and could be ridden like a flying broomstick.[1][3][4]Without a graystaff to augment their power, bheurs were far less dangerous. The graystaff was useless to non-bheurs, but if lost or destroyed, a bheur hag would have to leave thePrime Material Planein order to create a new staff. This process took a year and a day.[1][4]Bheur hags were also vulnerable to acid and electricity, but strangely resistant to fire.[4] A favorite feast for bheur hags was the frozen corpses of their victims, and often times in battle they would stop to devour them, stripping them of their meat and leaving only bones. The sight of such savagery was known to inflict a variety of possible conditions for varying periods of time, such as blindness, catatonia, psychotic breaks, babbling fits and extreme fear.[1][3][4] They were reported to have the power to increase in size, if only for ten minutes each day.[3]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","At the approach of each winter, the Rashemaar prepared diligently to face the winter out of fear of the bheur.[4]Every year, just beforeTarsakh, veteranhathranswere sent to battle a bheur hag, not necessarily to kill her, but simply to drive her away from the land.

They possessed an intellect similar tomonkeys, lacking in decorum and knowledge but compensating with cleverness and cunning. Whimpering when confronted directly, boggles made use of taunts and blusters only when their targets could not reach them.[3] Despite their lack of confidence, a boggle in its lair was an aggressive creature, as sly as it was insatiable. Like monkeys, they had no concept of treasure outside of shiny trinkets such as gold, gems, or polished pieces of garbage.[3]Charismatic souls could befriend boggles, especially by appealing to their love of food and sweets, although camaraderie as constrictive as alliances was usually short lived.[1][4]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Although some boggles had claws, others were less diligent in combat, having to pummel their assailants with closed fists.[1][3]Devious by nature, boggles would exercise their slipperiness to create opportunities to steal weapons or buy time to escape from pursuers.[1]","Boggles had remarkably strong senses. Though their noses could be broad, narrow, or nonexistent, their sharp sense of smell remained, powerful enough to sniff out even invisible creatures. Their huge ears were not for show, and much like adog's, could perceive noises imperceptible to most.[4] Young boggles, known as kits, had a greater elasticity then their older counterparts. They were able to bounce and roll throughout their environment as opposed to simply running. Older boggles on the other hand lost their bounciness, as well as their sharp sense of smell and eyesight.[4]","Social structure among boggles was loose, tribal and familial, with somewhere between 2-8 individuals living in any one area.[4]","All boggles shared a small array of strange powers that allowed them to engage in their escapades. Boggles sweated a nonflammable and slippery black ooze they could leave to puddle or trail behind them like a slug's slime. This ability could intentionally be invoked, although they also secreted the substance accidentally when nervous.[2][6]They were also capable of inducing an opposite effect, causing a sticky viscous fluid to flow from their pores instead and allowing them to climb on walls and easily latch onto people. When they allowed their oily secretions to pool, they could cause inch deep puddles that stuck people to the floor or resulted in slipping.[1]The fireproof oil that covered their bodies gave them a resistance to flames and heat.[1] The most enigmatic power of the bogeymen was their ability to turn any complete frame, that is, any rigid structure with a completely enclosed hole in it, into a dimensional portal before appearing from any similar point within a few dozen feet. Such places could be holes in the walls, open windows, doorways, bags or pockets, and cage bars. The frames they disappeared into need not have been wholly part of the same object. For example, the underside of a legged object like a bed or table contained a fixed hole between the object's base, legs and the floor, allowing dimensional travel. These portals were invisible and only lasted a few seconds, but usually not before the boggle stole or hit whatever it needed to through the rift.[1]Not all bogeymen were dimensionally bound in the same way, and some were thought to have the power to warp others through space, and even possess them.[2]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Boggle origins remained somewhat of a mystery to many, although two main hypothesis were normally proposed. One postulation was that boggles shared a common ancestry with goblins andbanderhobbssimilarly to humans and apes. Those who held to this idea believed that it was the boggles' space bending powers that caused them to become elongated and misshapen, and that they migrated to the material realm using fey crossings.[2]Secondly was the theory that like certain other fey beings, boggles materialized when strong emotions were felt in places between the Feywild and Material Plane. In the case of the boggle the feelings that generated them were purported to be intense emotions of loneliness, isolation, or abandonment.[1] In1357 DR, boggles could occasionally be found in thesewers of Waterdeep.[8]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Fury was their default emotion and they gained entertainment only in the struggle of combat. Their eagerness to fight sometimes overwhelmed their sense of self preservation, and only the threats of significantly more powerful beings, coupled with promises of future warring could keep them under control.[1][5] Disagreements among them turned violent extremely easily and they would immediately start fighting if they became tired of talking. Their form of speech was simplistic and animalistic and they also communicated through a weak telepathic empathy. To bulezaus, any activity that wasn't fighting was a waste of time, and they had no patience for guarding or sneaking. When a bulezau found something it classified as an enemy it attacked, and if no enemies were present then they would quickly try to find one.[5]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Bulezaus were neither smart, wise, nor charismatic, and despite grasping basic combat tactics could not utilize advanced fighting strategies, or lead other demons.[3][4]Thus, they relied on their physical capabilities and tenacity to do battle, often starting combat by roaring at the densest enemy cluster. They favored foes that could not or would not try to run away from them as well as those that seemed weak. Most owned a massive magical weapon in the form of a ranseur, but they sometimes wieldedlongspears,tridents,morningstarsand other long weapons.[4]Their skill in these weapons was shown particularly when charging, attacking quickly, and finishing downed targets.[2]When an opponent became too close for a bulezau to fight with their weapons they dropped them and stuck to their natural armaments.[4]","NOT FOUND","Bulezaus lurked within the deeper canyons and towering cliffs of the Abyss, most commonly on layers dedicated to warfare or ruled by barbaricdemon lordslikeKostchtchieorYeenoghu.[1][4]If not being intimidated into service by a more powerful demon they gathered into chaotic mobs, constantly scuffling and clashing amongst themselves unless a better target made itself apparent.[1]A lone bulezau was almost certainly the result of complete slaughter of their horde, most likely the result of their own self-destructive feuding.[4] Bulezaus had to be kept in line by a strong commander with significant charisma, demon or otherwise, often under orders to attack any bulezau that started a brawl. Tanar'ri leaders normally attempted to keep bulezaus at the front of a battle, as without some form of war to fight their mobs quickly descended into chaos. The threat of almost certain death was typically enough to restrain them for some time, but many of their superiors found themselves too late to stop a band of bulezaus from self-terminating.[4][5]Mortals attempting to call bulezaus to aid them found them annoyingly uncooperative unless random opportunities for violence were offered.[2] Ironically, despite their utter hatred for everything that was around them, bulezaus were among the most appreciated creatures within all of the Abyss. Although difficult to control, bulezaus could in turn be relied upon to almost never retreat, a rare kind of loyalty within the treacherous depths of the Abyss. Higher-ranking demons found bulezaus to be enough of a boon that they gathered them in large formations and created units of fanatical guards composed of them, despite the burden of dealing with their stupidity and quarrels.[5] Relatively high-ranking tanar'ri conscripts were also grateful for the bulezaus, as their enthusiasm for fighting theBlood Warmight allow the more subtle demons to sneak away unnoticed when they were around. However, weaker tanar'ri were frequently bullied by bulezaus and the creatures would savage them at the slightest provocation, with some cases having more dretches or rutterkin lost to the impatience of the bulezau than the invasion of thebaatezu.[5] Bulezau served a similar function tovrocks, being tough front-line infantry and assault leaders. Although vrocks were more magically adept and mobile, bulezaus were unwavering in their attacks as opposed to the flightiness of vrocks. The two sustained a bitter rivalry with only the presence of baatezu being enough to keep them from each other's throats.[5]Bulezaus held a similar animosity towardsarmanites, with which they fought with to claim the spoils of the Blood War during its hotter points.[8]They despisedgoodlyand virtuous minotaurs, but were quick to come to the call ofevilones.[2]","Bulezaus were dangerous even without weaponry, capable of ripping their enemies apart with tooth and claws, or charging and goring them with their horns. They used their barbed tails to strike foes in combat, causing those stricken to shed rotting skin, develop boils and even cough up flies. Their presence alone caused those near them to be wracked by necrotic energy, which increased in potency when more were nearby.[1]Their powerful legs allowed them to jump across horizontal gaps that were 20 feet (6.1 meters) wide, and they could jump up to half of that vertically. Despite their leaping power, their clawed feet grasped the ground tenaciously and they were difficult to knock down.[1] Their emaciated builds hid a terrifying strength, as they were able to wield weapons too large for normal creatures of their size. Once a day, they could emit a horrific cry powerful enough to blast apart enemy formations. They were always able to see invisible creatures and could summon a small mob ofdretches[3][4]orrutterkinsto aid them.[4] Bulezaus very easily went into berserker rages, whether from the scent of blood whipping them into a frenzy or simply from the thrill of combat. Failing to strike their targets made this more likely, with the rage stemming from a hatred of failure rather than the sheer love of fighting. It was difficult to get them out of this rage unless all targets were gone or they were forcefully restrained for a short period of time.[2][5]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Aeons ago, Baphomet created mortal minotaurs, which were divided in their ways.

He was forced to release the bulezaus into the Abyss to flourish, else allow them to keep killing his generals in their disorganized rebellions.[4] During the more tumultuous part of the Blood War, all demon lords, apart from Yeenoghu, enlisted bulezaus to serve in the front ranks of their armies.[2]It was said Baphomet maintained a small number of strangely disciplined bulezaus as bodyguards, a group regarded fondly by more powerful tanar'ri.[5]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

While they didn't permanently poison the land like theundead, the effects of bullywugs left due to their reckless practices was nothing short of disastrous for a few years, as they stripped acres of land bare[4][2][14]and left behind a despoiled morass of mud, a mere echo of a once fertile swamp.[2] The bullywugs were not unaware of this phenomenon, the difference in environment before and after they entered being so noticeable that even they viewed their own presence as ""off"" somehow. This sense of something being wrong manifested as paranoia, the sense that everything was out to get them somehow, although this feeling was not exactly untrue. Those that struck the scourge of bullywugs with particular precision or power sometimes felt a moment of renewed strength or clarity, as if the natural world itself was thanking them for their service.[2] Bullywugs were, appropriately enough, bullies,[3]and often their greatest joy came from lording over trespassers in their domains.[1]They believed themselves to be the true lords of the swamp and behaved as such,[1][15]being known to laze and loaf even as others worked.[16][17]They prized coins, jewels, and other treasures, although as individuals they lacked the same kind of greed and megalomania found in marauders likeorcs. Infighting within the same group almost never occurred, though some would suggest this was due to a lack of brainpower rather than malice.[4]Regardless of the truth of that idea, bullywugs were easily confused,[15]the smartest of them normally being of about average human intelligence.[4] Despite their tendencies towardschaoticandevilbehavior, bullywugs were capable of adopting other behaviors. They often remained individualistic, but sometimes shed their more despicable traits when trying to find a place in the outside world.[18]Curiosity could drive them to explore,[19]and those that met success were the ones that learned to work with and rely on others, with most stray bullywugs beingneutraland, on rare occasion, creatures ofgood.[18]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Anarmoredbullywug with ashieldand a peculiar-shaped weapon. Bullywugs reserved their natural methods of defense (biting and to a lesser extent their pitiful ""claws"") for foes that got too close to them, preferring to wield weapons whenever possible.[1][4][5]Most were barely able to wield more than a simple stone weapon (such as aclub),[11]so they stuck tospears,halfspears, and other sharp, piercing weapons that could be poked out of the water.[3]They normally leapt when in melee, since by springing through the air they increased the odds of hitting their foes, and when holding an impaling weapon, their strikes were twice as lethal. This made long weapons especially important, since they compensated for their slow speed when running and their exposed state when jumping.[4][5] Bullywugs also wore crude armor and donned shields when available despite these things slowing them down when underwater, trying to equip themselves with at leastleather armoras a point of pride.[3][4][18]This highlighted an oddity when it came to bullywugs, their illogical approach to battle. Bullywugs were fierce, aggressive creatures known to display fanatical loyalty to their tribes, and yet had little stomach for protracted fighting, which combined with their lacking minds made them somewhat unpredictable as far as combat went. Bullywugs were just as likely to fight to the death no matter how obviously doomed they were as they were to run for the hills after only a few of them fell, melting away into the swamp even if they easily could have won.[3][9][20] A bullywug brawl. Bullywugs did not favor fair fights, and were skilled in the construction and use of nets and snares.[4]They preferred to fight in or near water,[3]and given their camouflage and ability to suddenly spring into action, they were adept ambushers.[4][5]Bullywugs were emboldened by superior numbers and always tried to overwhelm the enemy by surrounding them. They hatedhumansand attacked adventurers on sight whenever their own groups were larger, but against serious threats, they normally left in search of easier prey.[1][15][4]Fittingly, bullywugs usually tried to summon monsters as the first part of any attack whenever possible, but given their issues with that art, there was a 1/8 chance they would accidentally summon more creatures than expected, lose control, and then waste their efforts fighting their would-be aid.[3] Most bullywugs outside of their homes trained aswarriorswhile some becamebarbarians, the tribe's biggest bullywug often doing the latter.[3]Some bullywugs had specific strategies; those known as muckers were strong and stout foes that jumped at their victims to knock them prone before kicking them while they were down, while others known as twitchers erratically spasmed around the battlefield, making them difficult to hit and difficult to avoid.[2]","Bullywugs wandering throughSlitherswamp, the 8thlevel of theUndermountain. Bullywugs preferred to inhabit dark, dank places isolated far from human beings, wet locations like rainforests, damp caves, swamps, meres, or virtually any other warm but shady region with abundant water.[1][3][4][5]They had adapted for easy movement among the trees,[24]with soft, suction-cupped fingers,[20]and had no difficultly moving through mud and wetlands[3]on their webbed feet.[4]Bullywugs had to routinely soak their entire bodies to keep their skin moist, at least three times a day with an averagewaterskin's worth of water. If unable to regularly hydrate, they would slowly weaken and die, hence why bullywugs feared dry heat and areas with little standing water.[1][4][18][11][5] Bullywugs slept in a frog-like fashion, burying themselves up to the eyes in pits of mud. At night, they were known to crowd on top of each other until everyone in that group was squeezed in, with multiple piles of bullywugs visible throughout their sleeping grounds.[25]","Bullywug society was savage, primitive, and tribal, one of the most petty-minded and mindlessly destructive of all humanoid organizations.[2][4]Bullywugs had learned to cooperate for the sake of mutual survival and hunting benefit with practically zero infighting,[18][4]but murder was still one of the two primary methods for getting ahead. The killing of one's rivals had to be performed secretly however, since bullywugs who witlessly did away with their opposition were likely to be executed by the others. Bullywug politics were typically more ""subtle"" than killing whoever was in front on the social ladder.[1] Aside from their gods, bullywugs only ever showed respect to their leaders, for their organized (or at least semi-organized) societies were socially fascist and so tyrannical as to be totalitarian. Absolute authority was vested to subleaders led by a male chieftain, a self-styled lord of the muck who could treat all his subjects as possessions and freely kill (and eat if he chose) his followers if they did not instantly follow his whims.[1][18][4]Only when the previous leader was too old to rule would the next dominant male kill and usurp (and possibly consume) him.[4] This foul aristocracy formed the basis of bullywug ""etiquette"", both amongst themselves and outsiders. Bullywugs introduced themselves with grand titles while groveling and kowtowing before their superiors, ceaselessly competing to win their favor.[1]It was in this sycophantic competition that the bullywug love and hoarding of treasure became important despite its lack of actual use in their societal system.[18]Instead of killing each other, bullywugs could advance by finding treasures and trinkets (including magical items) to present to their lord as tokens of deference or loyalty.[1] It was for this reason that bullywugs raided caravans and settlements, obtaining baubles and knickknacks to impress and win over their masters. Even if this succeeded and a bullywug got into the good graces of their leaders, the careless abuse and neglect that they so commonly showed their own property invariably meant that the fine items they acquired would become broken and dirty, whereupon the bullywug lord would invariably demand even more. Capturing intruders was favorable to just killing them because they could be dragged before the bullywug kings and their queens and forced to beg for mercy.[1] Bullywug royals were sneering and demanding, donning robes of leather, rough cloth, and marsh plants[1][21]even as most bullywugs wore no clothes.[4]Through bribery and flattery they could be convinced to release their captive audience, but not before trying to impress them with the majesty of their realm and the grandeur of their treasures.[1]Despite claims of being the masters of the marshes, bullywugs recognized their adverse environmental influence and perceived themselves negatively because of it, and that attitude extended to the bullywug lords.[1][2]Behind their pretensions to nobility and fanciful posturing was a deep inferiority complex, a desperate desire for legitimacy in the eyes of outsiders as beings worthy of not only fear, but respect.[1]","Bullywugs could deliver powerful bites[1]and were creatures of notable athleticism.[2]The amphibians were strong swimmers able to move rapidly under the water, even when weighed down by things like armor or shields. Despite being slow on land, with or without objects encumbering them, bullywugs could hop as fast as they could run (and possibly faster), leaping 20​ to ​30 feet (6.1​ to ​9.1 meters) forward or 10​ to ​15 feet (3​ to ​4.6 meters) high in a single bound.[1][3][4][5] A bullywug's camouflage protected them both from regular sight and frominfravisionsince their body temperature changed along with their coloration to better blend with their surroundings.[5] Some bullywugs, known as croakers, were flabby and weak compared to their kin, but able to belch up clouds of fetid, poisonous gas as they made their loud croaks.[2]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","In theDays of Thunder, circa-33500 DR, long before the appearance ofelves,giants, or evendragons, the amphibious creator race known as thebatrachiruled the supercontinent ofMerrouroboros.[38][39]After thesarrukhfell into a state of somnolent inactivity, the rise of the batrachi ensured that their descendants, thesnake-human hybrids known as theyuan-ti, would never reach the same level of prominence.[40]The batrachi worshiped Ramenos, who in these days was strong and active, and evidence of his dominion could still be found deep within jungles and lost plateaus where his ruins temples stood. Huge stone statues of the amphibian power dominated plazas and open areas around main buildings, his massive maw open to swallow sacrifices.[29] The batrachi reached the height of the power in-31500 DRunder the leadership of The High OneZhoukoudien, but their dominion was threatened by theJotunbrud, who Zhoukoudien had went to war with. His reign ended around that time when he was slain by thetitanthane Omo. In the final days of their civilization, circa-31000 DR, the desperate batrachi performed a ritual of epic summoning to defeatAnnam's titan armies, releasing several imprisoned primordials, including the Creator of Dragonkind,Asgorath. Unfortunately for the batrachi, the battle between the gods and the primordials unleashed unimaginable catastrophe across all of Toril. Continent-sized chunks of land fell into the ocean as the seas were rearranged, while earthquakes, windstorms and terrible fires scourged the entire planet.[38][41] The climax of this devastating tumult was the Tearfall, when comets and/or a moon of ice (suspected to have been hurled by Asgorath) crashed into Toril, merging the fourInner Seasinto theSea of Fallen Stars, and soon after tens of thousands of dragon eggs would hatch across the planet. An entity calling itself a batrachi lord spoke of the blanketing of the land with ice as the seven-turn winter, and the dramatic change in climate rendered the world uninhabitable for the batrachi. Forced to retreat from the fallout, the batrachi fled toLimbo, where they were changed for at least the second time by Ramenos to suit his purposes (with many confusing the batrachi for slaadi).[38][41] Back on Toril however, remnants of the batrachi lineage still remained.

Those who wished to become a cadaver collector's new master usually had to convince it that they in turn served its old master.[2][3] While they generally operated under the complete control of a master, cadaver collectors possessed rudimentary minds such that masterless collectors might venture out on their own to seek corpses, especially if they had gone for a long enough time without a mission that their minds started to breakdown. Some even developed the perverse logic to instigate conflicts to create corpses if there were none to be found, and in extreme cases, a damaged or malfunctioning cadaver collector might lose the ability to distinguish between a living and dead body, leading it to attack people directly.[2][3] They did not speak but could generally understand one language (determined by their creator, but usuallyCommon),[3]however it was also possible for them to have the ability to comprehend all languages.[1]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","A cadaver collector boasted a large and durable armored frame (which was capable of reducing if not negating incoming damage), superhuman strength, and an especially potent but unusual resistance tomagic.[1][3]They were immune to a wide array of spells, weaker magics would often simply rebound off them and back onto the caster,[3]and they were resistant to any effects ofelectricity(and in some cases, such spells would be absorbed and revitalize a cadaver collector).[2][3]Notable exceptions to their resistances included any spells which caused metal to rust or which altered the nature of their stone components, as well as spells which attacked with sound waves.[3]Even mundane very loud noises could interfere with their locomotion and cause them to slow down, and so explosions were a favored means of disorienting them.[2] Cadaver collectors lacked the intelligence to execute even moderately complex battle plans.[2]In combat, they attempted to use their spikes to impale enemies, both alive and dead, and were adept at both grabbing their foes and trampling them underneath their feet. Collectors could emit a paralyzing gas in a 30‑foot (9.1‑meter) cone in front of them, which helped to subdue any bodies that still had some life within them. They usually initiated combat with this gas.[3] Some cadaver collectors possessed the unnerving ability to enslave the verysoulsof any beings who died by being impaled upon their spikes, and could summon these captive spirits as berserkspectersto attack their foes. They could not summon the spirit of a creature that they had not killed directly, and a spirit could be freed by slaying either it or the cadaver collector.[1]","NOT FOUND","Cadaver collectors were designed to collect bodies from battlefields, regardless of the allegiance of the fallen, and were despised by any armies who saw them harvesting their comrades.[2][3]They were generally released onto the battlefield as the fighting was starting to end,[2]going forth alone or in squads of up to 5.[3]They would collect as many bodies as they could carry and then bring this cargo to a prearranged drop-off site before heading back into the battlefield for more.[2]Given their relatively narrow function, most cadaver collectors found themselves idle during peacetime.[3] Most often, cadaver collectors servednecromancersseeking to turn the harvested bodies intoundeadminions, however some were instead dispatched by military leaders—who wished to collect information about their enemies from the corpses—or by medical researchers—who needed bodies for study.[3]Someevilwarlords, particularly amonghobgoblins, favored the use of cadaver collectors not as scavengers but as fearsome weapons in their own right that marched alongside their armies.[1] The origin of cadaver collectors was disputed, with some scholars believing they were built by mortals[3]but that the method of their creation was lost long ago,[2]while others argued that they were native to theplaneofAcheron(where they could indeed be found wandering aimlessly).[1]Either way, they were ancient, and whenever a new cadaver collector appeared, it was not clear whether someone had rediscovered the means to make one[2]or had summoned it from Acheron.[1]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","As of the late 15thcenturyDR, cadaver collectors could be encountered in the city ofEvernightin theShadowfell.[5] In the course of theBlood War, analfeshneein service toYeenoghunamedBertheraanused a team of four cadaver collectors to build and maintain hisHouse of Gore, an ambulatory fortress made of corpses that shambled acrossAvernus.[6]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Enjoying a fight, a chasme was armed with two claws, a bite, and its nose-horn, with which it could gore a target, and all could cause bleeding wounds.[2][3][4][5]It could use all these equally well. It could attack on the wing, diving upon foes, striking, and flying off again.[3][4] They preferred to harass and torment their victims before finally killing them. Thus, chasmes used their speed and aerial maneuverability to maintain an advantage and their own safety at range.[2][3][4]They flitted from victim to victim, attempting to inflict bleeding wounds on many foes at once.[2]They also enjoyed assaulting their foes with their spells, typically favoringcontagion,insect plague,ray of enfeeblement,telekinesis, andwave of grief.[3][4]They savedray of enfeeblementfor foes in heavy armor or carrying a heavy load, so they might be overburdened if the spell sapped their strength.

Those in close earshot had to resist its drowsy effects, lest they fall into a deep sleep from which only vigorous shaking or being splashed with water could rouse them.[2][3][4][5][6]Though once this lasted a number of hours,[5]later chasmes could only make a victim sleep for up to two minutes,[3][4]or even less time, ending when the victim shook it off.[2]Otherwise, victims would awake to find a chasme sucking their blood.[5]Similar to asleepspell, this droning could affect any creature apart from fellow demons and those immune to sleep magic, such aselves.[2][3][4] Even viewing the hideous chasme was a disturbing, terrifying experience.[3][4][5]Formerly, anyone being touched by,[6]or even catching sight of a chasme had to remain firm or else flee in horror for a few hours.[5]Later chasme had to generate an aura of fear that affected those in the immediate vicinity, like afearspell, causing them to flee for only a minute if they could not resist.[3][4]After theSpellplague, they no longer had this power.[2] A chasme's claws and other natural weapons dealt savage wounds that bled profusely and cumulatively with their number. The bleeding continued until the wounds were treated by a skilled healer or closed through some form of magical healing. Without such treatment, a victim would eventually die of blood loss.[2][3][4][5] Chasme burst in on Cybriana, Jalma, and friends. A chasme wielded an arsenal of innate magical powers.

If a curious creature came close to inspect the body, it would be the next victim.[1]Even if not leaving a corpse for bait, they rarely dragged an entire slain body away, instead cutting it into smaller pieces and transporting those in stages to a safer location.[4] Chokers actually favored attacking creatures their size or larger, but would usually avoid attacking a group, unless very hungry, in which case they attempted to pick off the last in line.[3] To attack, the choker would lash out with both of its tentacle-like arms,[1][2][3][4]snapping them likewhips.[3]The tiny spikes on its hands could puncture a victim's skin.[1][4]The choker would then try to choke its victim,[1][2][4]either with a strangle hold[2][3][4]or by pressing the victim's throat against the wall.[1]It could often do this without having to leave the safety of its hiding place.[1]It goes without saying that a victim could not speak or castspellswithverbal componentswhile being choked.[3] It was next to impossible to break a choker's hold without killing it.

Some chuul, particularly older ones, would create lairs by digging up lake bottoms and building rudimentary structures from trees and stones.[2]A chuul lair consisted of roughly circular rooms that were interconnected by tunnels made just large enough for the biggest member of the resident pod to squeeze through.[2] One of the aforementioned rooms in a chuul lair would always be a trophy room, as chuuls were born hoarders. After making a humanoid kill, a chuul would keep aside something from the victim as a trophy, whether shiny armor, a piece of jewelry, or even a well-crafted saddle. If the victim was not carrying anything of interest, then the chuul would settle for displaying their skull in their trophy room. The skull itself would be empty, but not due to chuul consumption, as they would not eat the brain.[2]","Strong physical combatants, chuuls fought by grabbing and piercing their target with their enormous claws. After the unfortunate victim was trapped within the strong grip of a chuul's pincer, it was either simply crushed or brought towards the creature's mouth tentacles, which grasped and exuded a paralytic secretion. Even if the victim was able to resist the paralysis at first, they would eventually succumb[3], if not to the paralysis itself then to the creature's mandibles. A chuul would normally try to always have one claw free during combat, so that it could deal with any other opponents that might try to interfere. If facing a large number of foes, it would drop a paralyzed or dead victim before moving onto the next attacker.[4] Amphibious by nature, chuuls were actually not great swimmers.[4] Much like a number of other aberrant creatures, chuuls had psychic abilities. However, it was unusual for a young chuul to have access to such powers, instead they would gradually become able to exude psychic static as they aged. Older and larger creatures were able to emit a psychic moan that weakened resistance to psychic attacks and use a psychic lure to draw victims towards it.[2] Chuuls were also able tosee perfectly well in the dark, could fight even if blinded, were very alert, and had an innate immunity to poisons.[2][4]","Chuuls really only had two, seemingly contradictory, motivations in life: to be left alone and to eat people. However, even if one of these wants was denied the chuul, it would normally automatically get the other; if there was no-one to eat then it was undisturbed, if it was disturbed then there was most likely someone it could eat.[2] Despite their monstrous appearance, chuuls were actually more intelligent than they seemed, often settingtrapsand ambushes for their prey, although they were still far from civilized; lacking any sort of culture, ability to make tools, or settlements.[3]However, they did share a racial memory, which they possessed from the moment they hatched. This allowed a chuul to clearly recall events experienced by the previous generation of their race, but this became less and less vivid the further back it went.

But for over a millennium they were nomadic, traveling from plane to plane as they never found one they were willing to settle in for more than a generation. This life hardened most of them, gradually leading them to embrace their darker natures.[16] Among those sarrukh there were a few who despaired of their kindred embracing evil. They chose to break off from their peers and prayed to the deityJazirian, a fragment of theWorld Serpent, for aid. He responded by transforming those sarrukh into what became known as the couatl. The rest of the Okothian sarrukh declared war on their transformed former brethren, and despite their superior numbers the couatl held their own. This conflict continued until Jazirian was slain byMerrshaulk, a darker fragment of the World Serpent.

This would be the first sign of the god's return to his people.[19] Around the−3000 DR, the couatl population of Chult experienced a steep decline and sought out others to help them keep the yuan-ti from spreading their influence into the peninsula's western end. In their search they came to find thehumansandtabaxiofKatashaka, who they preached to of Ubtao.[18][20]One couatl, namedEcatzin, came to the Tabaxi tribes.

They also had superb senses of hearing, by means of tiny pits spaced evenly over their tentacles.[4] A darkmantle could slither much like a snail using its foot, but they could move much more quickly by using their tentacles like legs. This was actually its fastest method of locomotion. Its magical flight could provide lift, but it had to flap the skin between its tentacles for propulsion and was thus a clumsy flier, and its magic only kept it airborne for limited amounts of time. Darkmantles could occasionally catch a small meal in their mouths while flying, but this was rare.[4] To appear like stalactites, darkmantles would hang from their foot and press their eight tentacles tightly together to form a point.[4]They could also cling to a surface with their tentacles, hanging with their pointed heads downwards instead,[5]but their grip with their tentacles was not nearly as good—only their muscular foot was ""sticky"".[4] Darkmantles were about as intelligent asdogs,[2][3]and sometimes they were encountered in packs[2]known as clutches or swarms.[3] Darkmantles were prey for several cave creatures.

They typically hunted alone, preying on anything around them with blood, and when in combat were neither sophisticated nor subtle, violently lashing out at any nearby food source. While not stupid, death kisses tended not to strategize unless a foe was completely superior, such as against adragonor other beholder. This weakness showed in their tendency to play with their prey, leading them to make easily avoidable mistakes. The greatest strategy they might show in normal situations was to pull prey upwards as they drained them.[1]","NOT FOUND","Death kisses preferred to hunt alone, preying on whatever they found. They might submit to a more powerful being, although only so long as they could not escape.

Ingesting blood also caused the death kiss to recover from injury, so death kisses would seek to restrain their prey with their tentacles before draining their blood until death.[1]Because of the electricity in a death kiss's blood, causing them to bleed out would shock those nearby, and their death could cause a complete electric discharge.[2]","Death kisses would attempt to escape the clutches of their creators at the first opportunity, as they were clearly superior. They would typically submit to more powerful entities if only to keep their lives, lacking the egotistical nature of normal beholders. They were only paranoid about the loss of blood and so drained the blood of any creature they could find.

A sated displacer beast was just as likely to hunt and kill an unwitting traveler as a starving displacer beast. Like many other great cats, displacer beasts would play with their prey, keeping it alive until the cat was ready to eat. Once the prey was slain, displacer beasts used their tentacles to drag the carcass to a safe and remote spot to consume it.[4][7]Despite being evil creatures, displacer beasts never fought amongst themselves over food nor for dominance.[7] The creatures were capable of lightning-fast movement, either using all six legs or just the four hind legs, the latter making them resemble strange cat-likecentaurs.

Wild cat attacks surged in the area, even inspiring a bandit band to adopt an image of a displacer beast as their symbol. The presence of the creatures was considered a rumor by some, while others wondered where the beasts came from. They were known to roam lands between theMoonsea Rideand theNorthride. Many speculated that the beasts were unleashed on the Gap for a specific nefarious reason by an unknown party to cause fear and havoc in the region whilst disturbing the wildlife. Inhabitants ofTilvertonreported strange lights appearing in the area late at night, accompanying the prowling creatures with a sense of almost palpable foreboding.[20][42] CircatheYear of the Banner, 1368 DR, a mysterious killer adorned in a cloak of displacer beast hide terrorized the city ofWaterdeepto the chagrin of theCity Watch.[43]The killer was HuntmistressDhusarra el Abhuk, avampirefollower of Malar.[44] In theYear of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, a powerful displacer beast pack lord made a lair in thesewersofMulmasterin theMoonsearegion.

The fey creatures fell into alignment with the material world and poured through weakened barriers between planes.

Their faces were stretched so that they resembled those of dogs. Their skin was black and covered in a fine coat of white fur. They had a yellow-whitish mane of hair on their head.[3] Female draegloths were as tall as their brothers, but favored their drow ancestry; they looked mostly like a female drow, save for having two pairs of drow-like arms and a distinctly lupine cast to their features. Their fingernails and toenails were sharp and claw-like, but not so large as to interfere with spellcasting or delicate work.[2] Draegloth Abominations were the most bestial-looking of the draegloths. Their features included wicked claws, spider-like legs, and gnashing teeth. They had the ability to secrete webbing, which they used to tether foes and pull them into close quarters to be torn apart.[8] Draegloths were immune to poisons, as well as sleep-inducing spells and effects, and they were resistant to most elemental energy.[3]","5e4e3eVarious depictions of draegloths.Draegloth5e4e3e5th Edition Statistics[1]SizeLargeTypeFiendTag(s)DemonAlignmentChaotic evilChallenge rating74th Edition Statistics[2]SizeLargeOriginElementalTypeHumanoidKeyword(s)DemonAlignmentChaotic evil3rd Edition Statistics[3][4]SizeLargeTypeOutsiderSubtype(s)NativeAlignmentAlwayschaotic evilChallenge rating5General Information[1][3]Patron deityLolthVisionDarkvisionHomeland(s)UnderdarkLanguage(s)Abyssal,Elvish,UndercommonFavored terrainUndergroundAppearance[3][5][6][7]Average height7.5–8 ft.

Trained from birth in the clerical arts, they typically stayed at the rear of combat, relying on drow andspiderunderlings to keep their foes at bay whilst they made use of ranged spellcraft to battle them. If forced into melee combat, they could still rend foes apart with their claws and strength.[2] Draegloth abominations combined draegloth ferocity, drider cunning, and greater savagery than either of their parents. They were characterized as patient hunters, who stalked prey from the shadows and then ambushed it at the most opportune moment, using their webbing to drag foes from afar into close-quarters, so they could rip them to shreds.

Though it had not actually advanced their own goals, the Cult of the Dragon was emboldened, enough to emerge from the mists of secrecy in many places and serve their dragon masters openly and proudly.[12] As of1479 DR, the Cult of the Dragon was effectively commanded by Anabraxis, the Black Talon.[5] In the 1480s DR, a cultist namedSeverin Silrajincame to prominence.[6]Guided byTiamat,[6][78]he decided that theChronicles of Years to Comehad been mistranslated by Sammaster, and predicted that the world would be ruled not by dead dragons, but by living ones. He quickly rose through the cult's ranks until he became its leader, at which point he switched the focus the cult's efforts to summoning Tiamat into Faerûn at the Well of Dragons by finding and bringing together the five parts of theMask of the Dragon Queen.[6][13][79]The Cult shifted its efforts from eastern Faerûn to the west on the Sword Coast and from dracoliches to Tiamat and live dragons.[80]This plot nearly succeeded, but, following its failure, the Cult fractured between those who wished to return to their old mandate to honor undead dragons and those who wished to pursue the new philosophy.[78] Following Severin's plot, a new cell of the cult loyal to Sammaster was formed inNeverwinterand attempted a plot to use anorb of draconic influence, along with ancient tomes of necromancy salvaged from the ruins ofThultanthar, to magically attract dragons and then turn them into dracoliches against their will.

With their high numbers, dretches could be dangerous threats if they were more intelligent, but alas, they lacked anything that could be regarded as brainpower.[2]They were stupid, slow, quarrelsome, and uncreative creatures, with the main reason for their survival within the Abyss being that they made up an immeasurable horde.[1]They preferred using their sheer numbers to win their battles, their tactics rarely going beyond a mob rush,[2]as they normally ganged up on foes in hordes up to forty strong.[3]This close proximity amplified their horrible stench, and because most demons were immune to poisons, they could normally do this even when others were present.[2] Dretches served as the primary infantry in demonic armies.[7]Because dretches had some concern for their station they were more reliable, relatively speaking, than other cannon fodder troops of theAbyss.[4]At the same time, the cowardly creatures, unlike many otherfiends, had some sense of self-preservation instinct.[8]By themselves, they would flee from serious adversity, but their fear of punishment from (and desire to impress) more powerful demonic forces would keep them fighting when one was present.[3] In matters of war, the weak minds of the dretches could be both useful and detrimental. For example, they might be so terrified of those forcing them into battle that they would forget to actually fight, instead running directly at and over their foes. This could unintentionally damage the enemy formation, knocking them down and out of place, and create such confusion and disorder that it ultimately favored the dretches.[9]On the other hand, despite their sense of self-preservation, the dim-witted demons were occasionally known to require instruction to stop them from engaging in suicidal attacks, such as charging into awall of fireto get to their opponents.[10] Individually, dretches relied upon their claws and demonic resistances to survive.[1]","NOT FOUND","An Abyssal tavern with dretch servers.

Some acted as sycophants and helpers, attempting to be as useful as possible in the hopes of promotion, while others felt that their completely miserable situation left them with nothing to lose, causing them to rebel. With dretches being so incredibly numerous, many of them believed they could carve their own path, as they were too lowly to catch the eye of more powerful demonic entities. In truth, rebellious dretches were often slaughtered en mass by more powerful demons, to whom the dretches were free blood to spill.[4] Individually unimportant, dretches as a species played a huge role in theBlood Warand the Abyss in general. Tanar'ri constantly warred and fought amongst themselves, possessing no sense of kinmanskip or unity and thus not having as strong an impact on theMaterial Planeas they could. The key advantage of the demonic forces laid in their overwhelming numbers, and the uncounted billions of unimportant and petty dretches made up a vast fraction of those numbers.

Most harbored a death wish that made them want to die in battle— preferably when fighting drow.[8] They were tireless hunters and there were two reasons for this. First, hunting was the only thing that could give their lives meaning, second, they needed to drink blood at least every four days or their bodies started to deteriorate from which they could die outside of a battle.[9] As a result of drow repeatedly double-crossing driders and killing them at the end of a bargain, driders attempted to take some precautions to at least take the drow down with them at the time of death.[9]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Driders had a penchant for hiding and sneaking,[5]being able ambushers.

This and their general unstable mental state made it hard for them to feel fear.[9] Driders could reliably climb like spiders,[10]the only difference between these two species' movement abilities was the driders' inability to walk upside down on ceilings; they were too heavy for that.[9] About half of the drider population had the ability to spin webs like spiders.

"drow","Comparison of heights; from left to right: ahuman,sun elf,wood elf,moon elf, drow, andwild elf. In many ways, the drow resembled otherelves[23]oreladrin.[24]Their bodies were wiry and athletic,[23]while their faces were chiseled and attractive,[24]though they were shorter and thinner than other elven sub-races.[10][25][11]Due to a process of selective breeding that lasted for several generations,[10]the drow (especially nobles)[25]looked attractive[24]even in comparison to other elven subraces.[26]Though their alluring appearance could be used for seduction, it was more often utilized to instill fear.[24]According to the goblinNojheim, the beauty standards of the surface races made them prone to turn a blind eye to the deeds of the drow, showing them greater leniency and acceptance.[27] Reports varied on the physical differences between the drow sexes. Some purported that females were generally bigger and stronger than males,[23]while others claimed the males had superior strength.[28]Both sexes varied in height from 4 feet and ​7 inches​ to ​5 feet and ​5 inches (140​ to ​170 centimeters), averaging at 5 feet  (150 centimeters). Males weighed between 87​ to ​157 pounds (39​ to ​71.2 kilograms), averaging 109.5 pounds  (49.67 kilograms), while females were a bit lighter, weighing between 82​ to ​152 pounds (37​ to ​68.9 kilograms) and averaging 104.5 pounds  (47.4 kilograms).[11] Drow skin tones ranged from dark grey,[29]jet-black,[23]andobsidian,[16](with various shades of blue),[10][25][24]the albino drow known as theSzarkaibeing an exception.[23]Drow had white, black, or purple teeth, while their gums, tongues, and throats could be red, pink, or purple.[23] Drow eyes could be of any color,[29]with bright red being the most common.[23]Pale shades[16]that appeared nearly white of blue, lilac, pink, or silver were also frequent.[10][25]Drow with green, brown, black, amber, or rose-hued eyes existed, but they were rare. Purple or blue eyes indicated surfaceelvesand/orhumanancestry.[23]The color of a drow's eyes could also be indicative of their current mental or physical state; drow eyes reddened when they were angry, and turned yellow when they were sick, poisoned, or under some negative magical influence.[23] Drow hair could be stark white,[23][16]pale yellow[10][25]and, more rarely, silver or copper in color.[23][29]It thinned and changed color with age, turning pale yellow for women, and silver or grey for men.[23]Due to the Eilistraeen ritual ofThe Run, drow of other faiths would often say that silver hair was a sign of mental handicap.[30] Drow generally kept their hair long, and decorated it with pins and webbing made of precious metals.[24]They were incapable of growing proper beards, but some males managed to grow long sideburns or even tufts of wispy hair on the cheek or chin.[31] The majority of drow wore apiwafwi, a fire-resistant, protective cloak, footwear that functioned asboots of elvenkind, and adrow house insignia. The latter showed the House or merchant clan to which a drow belonged, be it as a member or servant. However, with the exception of the First House, insignias weren't openly displayed except when inside the House territory or the clan's base.[32][32] Noble drow wore clothes and equipment of superior quality (except, of course, when they didn't want to attract attention).[33]For example, a noble'shouse insigniadidn't just show house allegiance but also carried magic that could be used on command.[32]Web chokers' were considered fashionable by drow priestesses,[34]who also often used powderedOrmu, an Underdark-moss, as eye shadow.[35]","5e4e3e2e1eSeveral depictions of drow.Drow(Under-Elf[1])5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[2]SizeMediumTypeHumanoidTag(s)ElfAlignmentNeutral evilChallenge ratingDrow1⁄4Drow Gunslinger4Drow Elite Warrior5Drow Mage7Drow Priestess of Lolth8Drow House Captain9Drow Shadowblade11Drow Arachnomancer13Drow Inquisitor14Drow Favored Consort18Drow Matron Mother204th Edition Statistics[3]SizeMediumOriginFeyTypeHumanoidAlignmentEvil3rd Edition Statistics[4]SizeMediumTypeHumanoidSubtype(s)ElfAlignmentUsuallyneutral evilChallenge rating12nd Edition Statistics[5]AlignmentChaotic evil1st Edition Statistics[6]SizeMediumAlignmentChaotic evilGeneral Information[2][3][4][7][8][9][10]Patron deityLolthVisionDarkvisionAverage lifespanUp to 750 yearsHomeland(s)UnderdarkLanguage(s)Common,Elven(thedrow dialect),Undercommon,Drow Sign LanguageFavored terrainUndergroundAppearance[7][11]Skin color(s)Black, dark blue, grayHair color(s)WhiteEye color(s)Red, lavender, blue, purple, amberDistinctionsPointed ears, slim but athletic build, beautiful, affinity to darkness, able to enter fully aware sleep stateFemaleMaleAverage height4′7″‒5′5″ (140‒170 cm)Average weight82‒152 lb (37‒68.9 kg)Average height4′7″‒5′5″ (140‒170 cm)Average weight87‒157 lb (39‒71.2 kg)History[12]Based onDark elvesfrom Norse mythology;trowfrom Scottish folkloreDrow(sing&pl;pronounced: /draʊ/drow[13][14][15]or: /droʊ/dro[13][note 1]), also known asdark elves,[7][16]deep elves,[17]night elves,[15]under-elves,[1]and theDark Onesamongorcs,[18]were a dark-skinned sub-race ofelvesthat predominantly lived in theUnderdark.[19]They were hated and feared due to their cruelty,[20]though some non-evil and an even smaller number of good drow existed.[19][21]","Compared to other sentient beings, drow were notably intelligent, as having an analytical mindset and being observant at all times was needed to survive in their society.[23]Intellect, along with force of personality, were mental traits that had been ruthlessly selected for in their social darwinist civilization over several generations.[10]However, a lifetime of being indoctrinated with Lolth's dogma, combined with their upbringing giving them limited contact with other beings, surroundings, and alternative ways of life, made them close-minded, and left them with little worldly experience.[23] The drow (fittingly for the dark perversions of the elves they were) were decadent[24]and hedonistic beings with a love for what they considered beautiful and a desire to surround themselves with such things, generally without paying attention to the cost of acquiring them.[29]For example, they were often lecherous, with a tendency to take lovers at their leisure and discard them at their whim.[36]However, the drow were able to (or at least tried to) hide some of their more heinous traits behind a veneer of sophistication.[37][24] The moral code of the average drow was informed by the teachings of Lolth.[24]From birth, the drow were taught that they were superior to other races, and as such they believed themselves to be the ultimate beings.[38][31]This mindset created an arrogance so strong that drow could be incapable of viewing other creatures as their equals,[31]including members of their own kind; almost every drow believed themselves to be the epitome of their superior species.[39]The treatment reserved for non-drow ran the entire gamut from pets,[40]to slaves, to grudgingly respected partners if they proved themselves a military match for them, though never equals.[29] As one might expect, this atmosphere of utter condescension meant that most drow generally felt entitled to do whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted to do it.[29]If a drow was not where they believed they should be, their pride demanded they blame someone else (sometimes everyone else) for their incorrect position.[41]They were also taught that they should crush those beneath them,[38]for cruelty was seen as a method of self-validation. Those who could not defend themselves, as the logic went, deserved to have cruelty inflicted on them, which would prove the superiority of the drow performing the torment.[42]They were a vengeful people by necessity, as not answering to slights with punishment was easily perceived as weakness by other drow, and was essentially the same as inviting exploitation, abuse, or even death.[36] Most drow sought to rise in rank,[37]desiring the power over others that a higher station would provide.[36]Ironically for a race that put such a focus on individual merit, personal achievement and ability carried so little weight in their minds they had almost no notion of its worth. Military genius, battle prowess, magical capability, the ability to create, and all other skills had no intrinsic value to the dark elves. The idea of passion for one's career, and of an activity having worth in and of itself was alien; abilities and resources, whether obtained by training or granted by birth, only mattered insofar as it increased a drow's ability to advance in station, thus granting them more power over others.[22][43] Given the scarcity of resources in theUnderdarkand the limited chances for advancement within their society, most drow had to be aggressively competitive.[44]They had a propensity for violence, which was their favorite, even instinctive, form of conflict resolution, and they managed to fight this urge when waiting for a more propitious time to strike.[39] As a general rule, drow living within a Lolthite society could not afford to show emotions like compassion or love, for they were easy to exploit[31]and drow often preferred emotional cruelty over causing physical harm.[42]The strife they constantly endured led them to be paranoid, with a fear of everyone and everything, from the potential loss of personal position, Lolth's favor, the loyalty (or even the threat of outright rebellion) of their inferiors, to punishment by their own superiors' hands.[39] The end result of being raised in this environment was that the drow were untrusting sadists with a constant readiness to stab others in the back, both in the figurative and literal sense.[29]They were an emotionally stunted people[33]with a tenuous grasp on sanity (a trait they placed less importance on than cunning and deviousness) and scarred minds, among which relatively undamaged individuals were considered abnormal.[45][46]Most were incapable of trusting other creatures, no matter their race,[47]and were taught from an early age not to do so, as they were expected to advance at the expenses of others by any means, including treachery and even outright murder (although not overtly).[48][29]Even in moments of safety or relaxation, they were always alert and constantly expecting attacks of any kind, and were rarely surprised when such attacks did come.[23] While the drow understood the advantage of forging bonds with others,[31]they did not see the value in honesty.[29]Forming relations with others was therefore a dangerous endeavor, and mostly temporary, since any alliance or cordial relationship could end in treachery. Drow normally went into engagements of this sort expecting the worst,[31]and alliances were always under scrutiny for signs of treachery, often ending violently. They were generally formed when the supposed ally was susceptible to blackmail, considered weak enough to not be a serious threat, or when cooperation was forced by the existence of a common enemy.[49]In fact, the mere inconvenience of maintaining the bond could be a reason to end it.[29]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Drow were as frail as any other elves,[73]and had a fascination with stealth and subtlety.[29]They had a tendency to ambush their enemies with ranged weaponry, choosinghand crossbowswhen possible, to deliver their poisons from afar. They also favored light and quick weapons likerapiersin melee but normally retreated if close combat was the only remaining option.[73][74] Specific training was available for theirrogues,[29]which included lessons on how to blend in with the heat hues and patterns of their surroundings, similarly to how other races could hide in the shadows of light sources.[75]Their famous (or infamous)assassinschools doubled as assassins' guilds.[76]Male drow were normally competentfighters,[37]andrangerswere also valued as scouts.[49] Apart from its obvious use as a light source, drow used their ability to createdancing lightsto surprise the enemy with the sudden appearance of a glowing figure orwill-o'-wisp-like light balls. Teaming up with actual will-o'-wisps to make this more effective was a known technique, however, this was viewed as corrupted behavior.[73] Besides the obvious utility of cancelling light sources, the drow ability to createdarknesswas an integral part of their combat strategy, as it could be used to limit sight or otherwise hamper their enemies.[77]Since magicaldarknesslooked like black stone when looked at withdarkvision, there were many creative uses of the spell form a tactical standpoint. For example, a drow could hide behind the ""black stone"" and ambush their enemies from behind the cover, or use it to cover up a pitfall.[73] Like dancing lights, faerie fire could be used as a diversion, but the ability to change the colors of the lights allowed for the creation of color signals for the purpose of long distance communication.[73] Lolthtouched drow sometimes trained to slip into the cover of their created darkness,[72]or learnt to hit the targets ofdarkfirenot just more accurately, but also harder, similarly to howdrow wanderersdid.[78] The drow had a number of combat styles: Drizzt Do'Urden; a master of thedraa velvestyle. Drow with weapons drawn. Drowweaponsandarmorwere made out of a substance calledadamantine, an alloy ofadamantite, and then turned intodrowcraftitems. Such equipment could not withstand sunlight,[79]but was cheap and easy to produce.[80]Before the 1370s DR, every drow warrior, down to the lowest rank, was equipped with a drowcraftchain mailand (in most cases)buckleras well.[81]At some point during the early 1370s, these items fell out of favor[82]and the drow started to wearmithralarmor when it was affordable, but they kept using armor that wouldn't hamper their natural dexterity.[74] Famous weapons included thebolts of power,death lance,whip of fangs,[83]drow mission blade,hand spinneret, and thequeen's scourge. A well-known drow-made piece of gear was thedeath armor, legendary in the Underdark.[84]The drow created some weapons with the specific purpose to fight their own kind, namely theflash globesandlight pellets.[85] A drow falling victim to thecalling, a magicalpoison. Among the Underdark races, the drow were the most skilled in the use of poisons and toxins.[74][86]Especially famous was the powerfuldrow knockout poison, made from a slippery black fungus that grew in certainUnderdarkcaverns, and commonly applied to crossbow bolts to easily put enemies to sleep.[74]Other popular poisons were those extracted frompurple worms,scorpions, andspiders,[74]the so-calledcalling, theeyeburn paste, and theskullrot. Almost every drow put some individual effort into strengthening their tolerance to poisons as part of their training. This was done by ingesting ever-larger doses ofdrow sleep poisonand ofspidervenom, granting them further resistance to such toxins.[54] Their massive use of poisons led the drow to developed thevirulent weapon enchantmentto enhance the effects of any toxin applied to their weapons.[87]Naturally, the drow had some countermeasures against poison, like thering of antivenom.[88]","Sunbathing; the result of years-long training. Initial exposure to sunlight was dangerous for a drow and cause of heavy sunburns. Even after getting used to the sunlight, drow had a strong tendency to cover their skin and head when exposed.[264] Drow eyes were sensitive to heat, possessinginfravisionup to a range of 120 feet  (37 meters). Formal education or much practice was needed to ""read"" heat hues, as the drow had no innate ability to discern the meaning of the various patterns from birth. Cold objects appeared grey, while heat was seen, in ascending order of intensity, as blue, purple, red, and warm yellow.[75]They also haddarkvisionup to the same range, but not thelow-light visioncharacteristic of other elves.[10]It took a drow about ten years of exposure for them to get used to the sunlight and to use their infravision and normal vision simultaneously.[264] Drow had excellent hearing, a trait developed by necessity given the paramount importance of foreseeing rock shifts, collapses, and other hazards in theUnderdark. It was also the primary means by which they found water, by listening to the dripping sound it made. They had long, slender fingers and a keen tactile sense, to the point of being able to read subtle markings on stone as if they were Braille. On the other hand, drow had ahuman-like sense of smell, far less keen than in the other Underdark races and than their other senses. Smells were dulled in the Underdark, and the ubiquitous smell of damp rocks and the fungi-riddled air of their natural environment, combined with the strong incenses and the scent of slaves in the drow cities, made it difficult to develop a keen olfactory sense.[75] In contrast to creatures such as dwarves or deep gnomes, who had a deep, intutive sense of stone and subterranean conditions, the drow race's specialty laid in thesculptingof stone, the cutting and shaping of rock into smooth-flowing forms. About 70% of drow had an intuitive understanding of how fortifications or waterworks were constructed, operated, circumvented, and controlled, an innate ""feeling"" that extended to works made by other races.[114]They could recognizedrowcraftitems by holding them,[114]and if given a piece of Underdark-metal, or a cut or worn gem, drow could typically identify it. Upon finding a vein, like dwarves or deep gnomes, they had a sense of its direction, richness, and dimensions.[265] Drow liked to eat live animals because they believed the meat had a better flavor.[266] Like all elves, drow required no sleep, instead entering a meditative trance while retaining full awareness of their surroundings. The trance lasted around four hours, and provided the same benefits as a member of any other race having a full period of rest.[24][60] However, while elves relived parts of their memories, including those of past lives, during their trances, drow normally experienced nothing, save for the occasional dream (which they tried to interpret by looking for signs from Lolth). The fact that drow didn't relive memories of past lives during their trances was viewed as an indication that, unlike the elves, their souls didn't reincarnate.[204] The drow were believed to be more fecund than other elves,[267]though in truth, they simply had a higher readiness to birth as many children as possible during their lifespan.[33]For example, in the average Lolthite society, a female drow with an active career under her belt gave birth to about ten children before she lost the ability to birth more.[115] Drow lifespans were comparable to the rest of the elven race (and therefore far surpassed those of humans),[24]but the constant strife of their society kept their numbers low,[267]dropping their actual rate of population growth todwarf-like levels.[96]Provided they did not meet a premature and violent end, a drow's natural lifespan was about 750 years.[11]They started to show signs of aging at around 600 years,[268]and rarely lived past their seventh century, with about 94% of natural deaths occurring before 800 years of age.[269] Drow who could afford a lifestyle that spared them hardships, like matron mothers, could live more than 1000 years (though, by that point, they would be withered by age). Lolth's magic could maintain a matron's life for thousands of years, and this was considered a clear sign of favor from the goddess.[269] There were a number of races and creatures that were in some ways related to the drow. Various elves; from left to right; Drow, wild elf, sun elf, wood elf, and moon elf. Some races were not related to the drow because they were born from them but because they were transformed from drow.","Lolthite, drow society had had two nominal goals, called ""the First and Second Part of the Destiny of the People"". The former was about forcing all other races of the Underdark into subservience, while the latter was about driving the entire elven population into extinction, seizing their lands and holdings in the process.[47]Lolth claimed that, in order to achieve such goals, the drow had to be in a state of perpetual infighting and violent competition, the constant training serving to make them stronger and smarter while breeding out indolence and other weaknesses. However, the extreme, self-destructive degree to which the Darwinian attitude of the drow was taken prevented them from achieving either of their purposes, barring possibilities for significant growth.[98]In truth, despite her rhetoric, Lolth had no intention of having the drow devote themselves to reaching their supposed goal. She found their in-fighting far too enjoyable to focus their attention of taking the surface.[99] On a personal level, each drow tried to gain and maintain the favor of Lolth, amass material goods (like wealth and slaves), and gain status inside their society.[31]Depending on the station of a drow, there was a difference in the kind of plans they supported and executed. Drow of higher standing supported endeavors to boost their own prestige by increasing their own people's power and influence. Drow of lower station supported plans that dragged everybody down, for example by causing strife and violence within their communities.[47] Drow communities were known as city-states, although they weren't actually organized as ""states"", as much as clusters of drow led by oppressive, theocratic nobility. Cities were normally independent and not part of a larger drow nation, and though some had trade agreements, most frequently fell to war with one another.[76]Cities usually included farmlands, where slaves worked to produce and harvest meat and crops.[76]Those lands were usually found inside the main cavern but sometimes, usually due to space limits, they could be found outside as well.[100]","Drow were more agile than most humanoid races,[24]which, much like their higher intellects and force of personality, was a result of selective breeding over several generations.[10]Similarly, drow had a higher than normal tolerance for poison due to exposure over the course of countless generations. They had lesser resistance, in descending order, to the following kinds of toxins: non-drow sleep poisons,drugs,insectvenom, and injected poisons. They had no special tolerance for contact poisons or to poison gases.[54] Drow had tremendous resistance tomagic, with adults overcoming magic around half the time.[10][9]During infancy it fluctuated between almost non-existent and youth-level (resisting around two fifths of the time), stabilizing as they grew up.[55]It increased again when they reached adulthood, and could be trained even further,[55]but even if a drow's magic resistance was overcome, they could handle magical attacks quite well and had a better chance than other races at resisting them,[55]especially spells that attempted to bend their will.[10] Drow also had a natural aptitude for audible mimicry, the entire race possessing the capacity to easily imitate the sound and tone of another person in a believable manner, especially if frequently exposed to the language they were using.[56] Base powers were abilities that the drow could cast without any schooling, needing only simple practice. They varied slightly from person to person due to various reasons, including but not limited to genetics, personal talent, and divine favor. Drow magical abilities[57]were somehow tied to thefaerzress,[58]the radiation of theUnderdark, and its intensity in the birthplace of a drow could influence their base powers.[59]These abilities could also vary in the same person temporarily, depending on their personal (mental and physical) health situation, age, and degree of training. For example, a dying drow could double the effectiveness of the own innate powers by super-charging them with her or his own life force.[59] The drow could use their base powers once every day and, once employed, they could end the spell, move it around at their whim, or downsize it. Spells likedispel magiccould end a base power's effect. Normally, a drow could not continue using these abilities when they started using another one, or started to cast a spell.[59]A common or untrained drow could neither use nor maintain their innate abilities under the effect of light that was as bright as, or brighter than, sunlight, as it impeded their concentration.[55] A drow's innatedancing lightsspell-like ability[10][9][60][16]could create a larger number of light motes than the normal spell, and provided better control as the power of the caster increased; for example, the light spheres could be moved further away from each other than normal.[59]Reports varied if it could also be cast once per day, as with the other base powers, or at will.[59][60] In addition to the normal effects of adarknessspell,[10][9][60][16]which created an area that was impervious to normal sight andinfravision, a drow's spell-like variant could also create a globe that could be moved around and grew in radius with the strength of the caster.[59]They could further enhance the spell-like ability to cast it more often, and learn to deepen it so that adaylightspellcould not overpower it any more.[61] Unlike the normal version offaerie fire, a drow's spell-like version could create a glowing field that grew wider with the strength of the caster.[10][9][60][16][59]It could come in blue, green, or violet,[62]but while a drow could change these colors, they always manifested a certain one if they made no choice.[58]According toSeldszar Elpragh, a drow'sfaerie fireworked by channelingfaerzress.[58] Upon reaching a sufficient degree of expertise, the drow gained their so called ""mature powers"". These included the spell-like abilitiesdetect magic,know alignment, andlevitate.[59][16]Particularly intelligent and powerful drow could maintain two inborn abilities, or one inborn ability and one normal spell, simultaneously, usinglevitateanddarknessat the same time for example.[55]Like with base powers, it was normally impossible to cast mature powers in the presence of intense light.[55] Some drow were born with more magical power than normal, allowing them early access to their mature powers.[63][64]Such drow made up the noble class of their society, and among them this was a dominant trait.[33]Not only could nobles use both base and mature powers more than once per day, but every decade they gained another daily use, with centuries old nobility having virtually unlimited uses. Unlike commoners, they could attempt to cast their inborn abilities even in the presence of light, but they could only maintain one of their spells in this condition even when normally able to do more.[55] Before the 1360s DR, the drow would gradually lose their base and mature powers, as well as their defenses against magic, if exposed to sunlight.[65]However, during the 1360s DR,Liriel Baenre, guided by Eilistraee,[66]carved her rune in theChild of the Yggdrasilwith the intent of preserving her own drow magic away from the Underdark,[67]but the act ended up allowing all drow to keep their powers on the surface.[68]Despite Eilistraee guiding Liriel, speculations were that Lolth also had a hand in the matter.[68] Lolthtouched powers, the result ofLolth's blessing, were perhaps the most distinctive abilities of the drow.[24][69]Lolth's touch gave her a hold over the entire drow race, and overcoming it was only possible by becoming aredeemed drowwho also managed to be judged worthy byCorellon.[70] An image of aLolth-touchedbebilith, drow, andgiant spider. Lolthtouched drow manifested abilities likecloud of darkness, which would enshroud the given drow in shadow that was impossible for anyone but the caster to see through, anddarkfire, which made other creatures an easier target by surrounding them in harmless purple flames. Lolthtouched powers were seemingly fueled by the same source, and the use of such abilities were tiring for the drow, with only more experienced and well-trained drow able to cast both abilities separately.[71]Through training, drow could manifest the so-calledwebs of darknessthat both slowed and impeded a foe, while also limiting their vision. Curseborndrow could unlock even more Lolthtouched powers, including improvements of the aforementionedcloud of darknessanddarkfireabilities. Other ways to improve these abilities included training to cast thecloud of darknessfaster in response to harm, or to turn thedarkfireinto a flickering protective shroud that made the beneficiary harder to hit.[72]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","The history of the drow is filled with confusion and uncertainties. Many fanatical drow told lies and fabrications about their own history to serve the ends of the noble Houses and of the faiths.[288] At times, pieces of history were entirely deleted from the records. It happened to fallen noble Houses, as all information about them was erased,[288]to deities, as the matron mothers tried to hide all records of Eilistraee's existence,[217]and even to individual drow. For example, when amasked traitor, aspecialty priestofVhaeraunwho served as a spy in Lolth's church, was found out, any information about the traitor was literally extinguished from historical records, as if that person never existed in the first place,[289]and by four generations the fabrication was accepted as ""fact"".[288] The drow descended from the dark elves ofIlythiir, the first and one of the most powerful elven nations, and, in minor part, from the survivors ofMiyeritar.[10][290][271][49][291]One might imagine that the drow would constantly boast about this heritage, but the truth was that they didn't appreciate being reminded of their origins, for it also reminded them of their deep fall from power.[290]An exception was thechurch of Vhaeraun, whose goal was to elevate the Ilythiiri to their former glory.[124] On the other hand, the drow remembered their origins because their feud with the elves was based on history. They believed to have been punished by the Seldarine for their triumph in the FourthCrown War, and used this as a justification for their entitlement to exact vengeance on the other elves and their gods.[19]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Neophyte druids, were, for example, incapable of assuming a beast capable of extensive swimming, and only with a great deal of training could druids master the form of flying creatures. With practice however, the ability could become quite versatile and experienced druids could learn to cast spells in their beast form. The most experienced druids, known asarchdruids, were even capable of shapeshifting at will.[31]Others learned how to extend their shapeshifting abilities into taking the form of any individual person.[33] Other druids had less common abilities. Some druids had, in addition to theirwild shapeevocations,animal companionsthat filled some of the functions provided by wild shaping. A few druids were innate experts in the fields of botany andzoology, identifying various species with perfect accuracy by instinct. As a result, druids were naturally keen to deception by wildlife and fey. Likewise, druids held a natural sense for the safety of drinking water and many were immune to the effects of organic poisons. Several druids were also masters at moving through the wilderness at fast speeds, ignoring the hampering effects of natural hazards such as thorns or briars.

Both male and female duergar were typically bald, with females also lacking the capacity to grow facial hair. Many were also thinner than their dwarven brethren.

Rather than a flaw, however, they viewed their lack of happiness as their greatest strength, the defining feature of duergar pride. The duergar saw themselves as the true paragons of dwarvish ideals compared to their weak and pampered kin, but in truth, their ways were a dark reflection of those found in normal dwarves.[20] While they did display the redeeming virtues of determination and bravery, duergar took dwarven flaws to their logical extremes. They were violent and hateful, sullen and insular, greedy and ungrateful, deeply cynical of others' motives and dutifully tracked and nursed every grudge, whether or not any offense was meant.[21]Though their vices were many, the moral failings of the gray dwarves could be traced to three primary principles: bottomless greed, unceasing conflict, and rejection of emotion.[22] Most dwarves were accustomed to the inevitability of struggle to be found in existence, but such knowledge was colored by their essential love of industry. Dwarves enjoyed their work, from the art of crafting to the trials of their everyday lives, seeing opportunity for success where others saw labor.[9][23]In contrast, duergar industriousness was spurred on simply by the primal urge to build and create, driven by a need to own and acquire as much as possible.[20][24]The duergar were dauntless perfectionists[11]who never left a job half done and worked hard to excel in their field,[21]and yet the dwarven ideal of achieving mastery of a craft meant nothing to them.[9] Duergar creations weren't flawed or subpar, and in fact were rather enduring, but were completely utilitarian, considered valuable only for their function and bereft of warmth and artistry. Appreciation of beauty had been erased from their minds, the aesthetics of their creation ignored. Their works were not labors of love, for their goal was not quality, but quantity, an attempt to craft as many items as possible as fast as possible. At the heart of duergar efforts was simply desire, an insatiable desire for wealth and prestige. Yet even when their great schemes to acquire succeeded, the success was never cause for celebration, each acquisition just as incapable of satisfying their unending need for more.[20][22][9][2] The higher a duergar rose and the more items they possessed, the stronger they would need to be to hold on to what they already had.[22]They were not above stealing to get their beloved gold, and by making war on others they demonstrated one of their principles: might makes right. The weak were unfit to possess what was meant for the strong and those too weak to defend their holdings or themselves were considered by most to be unworthy of pity. Most placed little value on the lives and possessions of others, or at least their rights to these things. The helpless, weak, and less fortunate than themselves earned little mercy, yet all-consuming envy was harbored for anyone relatively better off.[22][21] The suffering of others was one of the rare times that the duergar could feel some semblance of happiness. They enjoyed tormenting those vulnerable to their predations, but this was not to be mistaken for the wasteful and extravagant displays of cruelty shown by the drow. Rather, the duergar enjoyed more ""down-to-earth"" suffering, working others to the death and using cruel jokes and petty abuse to bring a momentary smile to their faces.[11][21]The closest they came to feeling true joy was when satisfying their violent urges and desire for treasure, especially when raiding dwarven strongholds to do it.[24] To show weakness was a mortal sin to the duergar, whether on an individual or societal level. To their minds, weakness included such emotions as happiness or kindness,[22][9]and they had no tolerance for those that failed to show the proper levels of ambition and cruelty.[18]While regular dwarves showed a lack of trust to outsiders, they had strong family bonds, their dedication to furthering their clans and leaving behind a proper legacy showing in every aspect of their activities. The duergar inverted this value, for while they were bound by their rigid society, they did so because they had to, and indeed had no love of their kin.[9] The gray dwarves were consumed by feelings of bitterness, convinced not only that their race had been denied their due, but that the world, other dwarves, and even their own kin and clan had cheated them of their birthright.[11]They were forbidden from trusting others[9][22]and raised from a young age to believe that betrayal was simply their inevitable fate, a self-fulfilling prophecy.[11]Though the duergar were assigned life partners, this was merely to ensure the continued survival of the clan, for life in the Underdark required cooperation. The creation of a legacy was not considered because they had abandoned individuality, each member of society expected to perform their determined role as best they could.[9] In the eyes of the duergar, life was nothing but harsh endless, toil, working from the cradle to the grave in ceaseless labor and drudgery. They were taught that this was their lot in life early, and so expected nothing else.[11]In many ways, their lives were fundamentally empty, a hollow, unfulfilling version of the dwarven way of life. Despite their many accumulated treasures, their successful military operations, and all their pride in the purging of their weakness, the duergar felt no happiness or satisfaction.[20]Indeed, they had no memory of what it meant to be happy, or even what it meant to be truly proud. They simply continued to toil and grumble about their lives, existing as cogs in a machine to forge products they cared not for, a life antithetical to joy and purpose found in the dwarven cycles of creation.[2][20] On the positive side of duergar behavior, they shared the dwarven virtue of minding one's own business (at least as long as others didn't have something they wanted). Though most wereevil, a fair number leant towards hardheartedneutrality, wanting nothing more than to be left alone, and a rare few managed to becomegood.[21]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Duergaradventurerswere most commonly concerned with personal gratification, and were frequentlyfightersorrogues, leaning on their training against the threats of the Underdark.

It was disputed how many memories of the deceased they inherited, if any, but their natural deceptiveness and acting ability helped them to pass as their host regardless, normally keeping the victim's possessions and imitating their lifestyle.[1][2] Despite their expertise in impersonation, dybbuks struggled to keep their nature under control for long, quickly descending into uncharacteristic debauchery, delighting in sordid behavior.[1][2]They also derived glee from horrifying witnesses by making their bodies act in unholy ways, such as puking blood, excreting vermin, or contorting limbs to scuttle across the floor.[1]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Dybbuks were elusive and predatory but avoided combat when in their true forms as they knew that it was only then that they could be truly killed.

However, bodies they'd been expelled from but which were still in usable condition could be repossessed seconds after the dybbuk left, restoring them once again to peak condition.[1][2]An effective means to ward a corpse from a dybbuk was to createmagic circles against chaosorevilor similar dispelling magic, which would not only drive the dybbuk off if they were already possessing the body but also daze them for a short time upon doing so.[2] Even without a host, dybbuks were incredibly dangerous creatures that sapped the very vitality from those they fought through their touch, causing flesh and bone alike to wither and crumble. Once per day, they could focus their necrotic power to create a truly chilling effect, potentially killing those that couldn't resist with their touch alone, even when inhabiting another form.[2]They could inspire terror similar tofearandphantasmal killerspells, when not simply twisting their hosts to frighten onlookers, and could createmind-rending mists. Their incorporeality made them difficult to pin down, especially when combined with their power to createdimension doorsor simpleobscuring mists.[1][2][2] Dybbuks could also impart a kind of unnatural gift, filling a target with anger and causing their eyes to glimmer white. The profane link between the two allowed it to monitor the recipient's condition, similar to astatusspell, and possess them upon death when on the same plane, no matter the distance between them. Willfully accepting a dybbuk's gift, while not necessarilyevil, was achaoticaction that caused even the mostlawfulindividuals to radiate an aura of chaos. Wicked strength filled the recipient, and their very strikes were empowered by the forces of chaos. The gift faded after a day's time and could be prematurely ended through adispel chaosspell.[2]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Notably, ettins had crude,orc-like traits in the form of a large, watery eyes, porcine snouts, and shovel jaws with lower canine teeth that protruded out like boar tusks, tusks that, for all their easiness to reach, were as revoltingly rotten as the rest of their teeth.[1][3][4] This uncleanliness extended to their sense of dress, or lack thereof; ettins wore animal skins that were uncured, unwashed, scraggly, and that were typically decaying and being eaten by moths.[7][5]The only reason they wore them was as a kind of mobileblanket, giving them something soft and warm to sleep in, and the ugly sleeping-furs normally didn't include sleeves or any unnecessary parts so as not to impede them in physically demanding tasks.[7]This wasn't to say that the idea of accessories was completely beyond them, with some keeping things like severed heads as accessories and females being known to wear jewelry as a status symbol.[7][10] Generally males were taller and heavier than females, but females, as well as having longer hair, were often fuller-bodied than the relatively gaunt and wiry males.[7][6]","5e4e3e2e1eVarious depictions of ettins.Ettin5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[1]SizeLargeTypeGiantAlignmentChaotic evilChallenge rating44th Edition Statistics[2]SizeLargeOriginNaturalTypeHumanoidKeyword(s)GiantAlignmentChaotic evil3rd Edition Statistics[3]SizeLargeTypeGiantAlignmentUsuallychaotic evilChallenge rating62nd Edition Statistics[4]SizeHugeAlignmentChaotic evil1st Edition Statistics[5]SizeLargeAlignmentChaotic evilGeneral InformationVisionDarkvision[1]Low-light vision[3]Average lifespan75 years[3]Language(s)Pidgin ofgiant,[1]goblin, andorc[1][3]known colloquially as ""ettintongue""Favored climateSubarctic to temperate[4]Favored terrainHills and mountains[4]Appearance[6][3]Average weight930‒5,200 lb (420‒2,400 kg)[3][6]Skin color(s)Pink to brown[4]DistinctionsTwo heads[4]MaleFemaleAverage height13′‒13′10″ (4‒4.22 m)[6]Average height12′4″‒13′2″ (3.76‒4.01 m)[6]HistoryFirst appearanceMonster Manual1steditionBased onEttin, the English form ofJötunn(Norse)Ettins, commonly calledtwo-headed giants,[3][7]were the conjoined twins of the giants, degenerate brutes whose names translated to ""ugly giant"" in ancientCommonand ""runt"" inJotun. They bridged the gap between true giants and giant-kin, only being classifiable as the former by virtue of relation toAnnamandOthea, but with no terrain granted to them by the All-Father.[1][6]","Aggressive, ferocious and unpredictable,[7][3]ettins were a brutish race that loved and admired power. They were natural bullies that oppressed those incapable of defending themselves, victimizing the weak through straightforward pain and intimidation.[9]It was possible that they held a traditionally ""muscle-brained"" view of the world, perceiving mental prowess and good looks as inferior to raw size and strength.[10]Despite their two heads, or perhaps as a result of their two heads, ettins were generally stupid, their two weak brains doing little to enhance their overall intelligence.[7][11] Adragonbornconfusing an ettin. With that in mind, trying to take advantage of an ettins feeble mind was risky; if either head of an ettin were to see through an illusion for example, they would not stand slack-jawed and bewildered by the event but immediately and angrily conclude they were being tricked and seek out the one trying to deceive them.[7]It would also be a bad idea to assume all ettins were equally dim-witted, as the lowest of them were more akin to wild animals while the smartest members of their kind had been known to surpass the averagehuman.[6]Ettins also weren't universally mean and destructive, the circumstances of their lives playing an important role in shaping their instinctual savagery. Some ettins were known to be curious, imaginative, humorous, and even kind, with friendly, or at the very least non-aggressive behavior, being more likely among those with comfortable lives and an ample food supply.[10][12][13][14] Ettins had a concept of value, keeping things like corpses as trophies and collecting gems, coins and art objects to ogle at.[10]They also knew the basic principles of trade, though they were suspicious of all beings, including each other, and might bargain with potential prey if more could be obtained by doing so, such as something to ensure their safety or the obtainment of more food. Generally ettins only bargained to get as much of what they wanted with the least possible risk, unbound by their deals and willing to abruptly stop discussion if it proved frustrating or annoying.[7]Despite their wariness and greed, ettins understood gratitude and had been known to take substantial risks for those who managed to earn their trust, those willing to risk their lives to help them for example.[12]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","An ettin attacking. Ettins proved dangerous opponents capable of surprising acts of unity when in combat, their two heads being more useful than they might first appear. Because ettins had two heads, their bodies were driven to move twice as fast as a similar creature with only one head,[9]the left and right arms able to act independently without issue.[4]Despite their size and idiocy, the long-armed ettins also had the advantage of being able to strike shorter opponents likegnomeswithout particular difficulty, as one head was always alert.[8][17] Though they had a tendency to attack on sight[8]and often kept fighting until all their opponents were dead, not being ones to retreat too easily, they weren't overly careless, above fleeing when victory seemed impossible, and didn't engage obviously superior opposition when they could simply run.[4][7]Some of the more intelligent ettins were known to learn how to cast spells, some asbardsand others asshamans, and given the proper training one head could cast spells while the other attacked as easily as both could swing their weapons.[11][15][18] Fortunately for everyone besides them, ettins generally lacked the intelligence to make full use of their advantages, although their stupidity was counteracted by their primitive cunning and crude sense of tactics. Ettins were ambush hunters who would rather jump weak victims then get into a straightforward fight,[3][4][7]more capable of short bursts of great strength than protracted melee.[14]They hunted at night to take advantage of their superior senses and avoid being attacked by diurnal adversaries, and any idea of honor or truces in combat was alien to them.[7] Despite their ruthlessness, ettins weren't too deadly if confronted properly, a basically competent band of warriors with decent armaments being able to lay them low with relative simplicity.[8]Their generally immorality meant that the crueler ettins could be lured intotrapswith the terrified screams of a potential victim.[9]If the heads were somehow turned against each other, an ettin could be made into its own worst enemy as it visibly attempted to restrain and batter itself into submission.[19]The two-headed giants neither possessed nor desired finesse, a sign of their attacks being the destroyed structures and toiled earth left in the aftermath of their clumsy smashing. Bestial, slobbery howls of pain and frustration could be heard when they were when evaded by nimble enemies[7][9]and when flanked resorted to swatting the pests away.[2] They greatly preferred fighting in melee, favoring weapons that crushed and battered like spikedclubsand iron bars, and even without weapons they could still try to improvise, unhesitatingly uprooting trees or breaking furniture to use them as weapons. Failing that, they would pulverize their opponents with their fists, but if no other option presented itself they could utilize the typical giant method for besting ranged opponents; throwing rocks.[4][7]Ettins would also make use of more advanced weaponry likebattleaxes,morningstars, orjavelins, as well as don armor to protect themselves.[1][3]","NOT FOUND","Already without privacy or isolation throughout all of their lives, ettins violently sought solitude, crushing any trespassers in their domains without question nor warning. The last thing most ettins wanted wasanotherindividual to deal with, much less another member of their kind, as a shouting match between four pugnacious primitives was even more intolerable than the ordinary state of affairs.[1][3][4]Only rarely would they gather together into small groups, as gangs of living mates or bands of wandering destroyers, if an ettin of particular power, intelligence, or strength of will presented itself. These groups, anywhere between a 2-5 in numbers, cooperated with one another only so long as there was some perceivable benefit in doing so and if the leader stayed alive and undefeated. The death, departure or discrediting of that leader, or really any major loss suffered, was often enough to shatter group cohesion and break up the band.[9][3][4][7] Despite placing little value in currency outside of its aesthetics, ettins collected it regardless because other, lesser creatures found it desirable.[3][4][7]","Aside from great strength and a thick hide, ettins were relatively simple in terms of their abilities, little more than biggerogreswith the exception of their two heads.[4]An ettin's heads granted it protection against mental controlling spells, and unless the spell affected more than one individual, only one head would fall victim to it. The other head, meanwhile, would remain active, although the arm opposite to them might be limp and useless depending on the effect the other head was being subject to, allowing that side to be disarmed easily.[7]Ettins themselves only rarely had the mental fortitude required to cast spells, although some were known to havesorcerouspowers.[14][15] An ettin's two heads contributed to its keen senses, including their excellentinfravision. Though ettins could see in light and weren't impaired by it, they disliked and avoided sunlight and other strong sources of brightness likecontinual lightspells (torches or regularlightspells were too weak to affect them this way). This great distaste was caused by a combination of instinct, conditioning and self-preservation; they were likely to be left alone in dark and hidden places and it was more dangerous for them when it was bright out. Their sense of smell was also sharp enough that they could distinguish between animals and civilized beings, unusual and familiar surroundings and identify specifics purely through olfactory means.[7]Combined with the fact that one head was almost always alert while they were sleeping, and it made ettins a difficult race to surprise.[1] In many legends regarding ettins, it was said they, similarly tohydras, could regrow their lost heads, and while this wasn't true it was unclear whether or not an ettin could survive with a head missing.[7][9]On one hand it would seem that it would be impossible as the jugular vein would have to be cut, but then againchimerascould survive when one of their heads were removed. It was said that ettins possible had some kind of instinctive muscular or biological reaction to having a head removed that rerouted blood vessels and nerves to go to the other head.[7][16] Regardless, an ettin with its head removed, assuming it survived, would be at a serious disadvantage, losing all unique benefits of having two heads. Losing the lesser head simply forced the dominant to take full control, although the loss of the dominant head left the remaining head wildly and clumsily flailing the other side of their body. It would take two months to learn perfect control after such an event and a one-headed ettin would be looked down on by others as deformed, although given that they already didn't care about one another's opinions this was a minor detriment.[7][16]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","A biclops had two eyes, but not as a set.

However, they were but echoes of who they were in life.[1] Keeping their intelligence but left quite, quite bored and very lonely by their long watches, flameskulls typically went insane and could display strange behaviors. At all times, they wanted to be entertained by whatever was going on around them and sought for some form of companionship.[4] They had no purpose in death but to guard that which they were created to protect. If it should be destroyed or stolen despite their efforts, or they could otherwise no longer serve their purpose, they were released from their guardianship and became independent.[4][1]However, rather than attack the one responsible or seek their own destruction and escape from undeath, they would exhibit a form of gratitude and thereafter accompany the one responsible, floating just out of reach and making smart comments.

This ""evil eye"" emitted light and differed in iris color as well as pupil shape, often resembling acat's eye.[13][3] Their deformed bodies were covered in large warts, wandering pustules, and weeping lesions. Internally, their veins and organs bulged and lurched. Their skin tone commonly matched that ofhill giants, but also ranged from purplish-gray to pale white. Hairlessness was relatively common among fomorians of bothsexes,[3]though some were known to have scattered patches of wriggling hair that was as tough aswire.[7]There was no single odor associated with them – some left no scent, while others smelled strongly due to rainbow-hued fluids produced by overactive sweat glands.[6][13] They largely wore makeshift scraps of cloth,[9]though some were known to dress in kilts andtabardsof fine quality.[3][14][note 1]They tended to work any bits of metal or pieces of armor they could find and scavenge into their clothes for added protection.[6][7]","5e4e3e2e1eVarious depictions of fomorians.Fomorian5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[1][2]SizeHugeTypeGiantAlignmentChaotic evilChallenge ratingStandard8Deep Crawler10Warlock of the Dark12Fomorian Noble154th Edition Statistics[3]OriginFeyTypeHumanoidKeyword(s)GiantAlignmentEvil3rd Edition Statistics[4]SizeHugeTypeGiantAlignmentUsuallyneutral evilChallenge rating112nd Edition Statistics[5][6]AlignmentNeutral evil1st Edition Statistics[7]SizeLargeAlignmentNeutral evilGeneral InformationVisionDarkvision[1]Activity cycleAny[6]DietOmnivore[6]Homeland(s)TheFeywild(Feydark) and theUnderdark[1]Language(s)Giant,[1][4]Undercommon[1]Favored climateAny[4][6]Favored terrainMountains, underground[4][6]Appearance[8][4]FemaleMaleAverage height13 ft  (4 m)Average weight660 lb  (300 kg)Skin color(s)Pale white or purple-grayDistinctionsVarying degrees of deformitiesAverage height13 ft 6 in (4.11 m)Average weight1,000 lb  (450 kg)Skin color(s)Pale white or purple-grayDistinctionsVarying degrees of deformitiesHistoryFirst appearanceMonster Manual II1steditionBased onFomorian(Irish)Fomorianswere a race ofgiant-kinsupernaturally altered by an ancientcurse,[9]considered to be the most hideous and wicked of all thegiantraces.[6][7][10]","Fomorians were known to be verychaotic evil-aligned creatures, greedy and disloyal by nature.[9]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Due to their deformities, fomorians were incapable of throwing boulders the way other giants did.[6][7][9]In combat they utilized all varieties of blunt weaponry.[6]They were often known to wieldgreatclubs,[9]flails,maces,[3]and giant-sizedbolas.

Although useful in the Stygian wastelands, his bestial savagery was also a weakness that negatively impacted his ability to garner souls and forge proper hierarchies.[8]Despite his barbaric nature and his ""Lord of the Filth"" title, a mocking play on words similar toBaalzebul's ""Lord of the Lies"" epithet, Geryon was ironically immaculate and preferred a clean environment, leading some to believe he was slightly insane.[1]","Geryon's primary residence was Stygia, the untamed fifth layer of Hell and one dominated by frigid oceans and ice floes. During his rule, monuments were made in his honor like the Pillar of Geryon that floated along the River Styx on the iceberg Elgarz. The granite outline, similar to a cave painting, showed Geryon cutting off right hands and replacing them with powerful, fiendish versions, requiring the wielder to commit evil and lawful acts to retain their power.[12] Originally he ruled the layer from the city of Tantlin, that had been built from one of the largest and most central icebergs in Stygia.[10][13]After his exile however, Geryon was forced to abandon the seat of his power that beforehand he almost never left, although he had recently managed to reclaim one of his oldest dwellings, theCitadel Coldsteel.[8][10]Geryon secretly constructed the fortress by hollowing out an iceberg deep within Stygia and it was often compared to a surgeon's scalpel due to its almost clinical sterility and dangerous nature.[1][14]The majority of the fortress was unpleasantly cold to most devils and lethally so to most mortals staying for extended periods of time, although the bottommost layer was oddly warmer as it went so deep that it was halfway between Stygia andMalbolge.[14] The mile around Geryon's lair was filled with the sounds of howling, either from creatures or simply the chilling winds, and portals seeming to lead to safety occasionally appeared only to put travelers somewhere else in Stygia. Within his lair itself he had the ability to banish and restrain those before him and cause bursts of arctic energy to shoot out from the ground.[8]","Before being replaced, Geryon occupied himself by hunting those he lured into Tantlin with elaborate plots. He tried to entice the most powerful prey from beyond the Nine Hells with contrived rumors of riches and lore, imprisoning any survivors of the onslaught within his quarries.[5]Although he still enjoyed simple pleasures, like coiling up in hisdragon-like treasure hoard, Geryon was brooding and had a new mission; namely putting himself back in power.[3][9] Geryon's primary motivation was to regain his lost authority and retake Stygia, so most of his time was spent designing nefarious plots against Levistus.[1][8]He had carefully crafted a secret army of fiendish mercenaries and renegades and, like Zariel, spawnedcambionsto act as leaders in his legions.[1][7]After much scheming, he finally began open warfare against the Frozen Prince, turning the already wild wastes of Stygia into a complete war zone. Outside of those reserved for theBlood War, devils of Stygia were constantly battling for either Geryon or Levistus. This could involve taking part in the never-ending skirmishes that happened throughout the plane or searching for knowledge that could be used to free Levistus or allow Geryon to vanquish him.[8][7] For some indiscernible reason, Asmodeus had done nothing to stop the power struggle and indeed Geryon still harvested souls and served the archdevil in hopes of being returned to power. Although technically the ruler of Stygia, Levistus was still trapped in a block of ice, leaving neither one able to directly affect the other.[1][8]This meant that, practically speaking, two archdevils ruled Stygia, although unlike withBelialandFierna, the two were fully hostile to one another.[7]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Glabrezu took pleasure in the act of temptation, luring all they met with lies, deception, and offers of power before ruining their victims' lives.[1]The secret agendas of a glabrezu were many, their complicated schemes and spiteful plots for vengeance sometimes taking centuries to millennia to finally come to fruition. Furthering their guile was their commanding presence, as they had a strong air of authority they used to enhance their arguments.[9] Glabrezu did not offer pleasures of the flesh, but tempted those of weak wills and great ambition with promises of unparalleled influence. They collected vast sums ofgold,magical items, and other useful bargaining chips and stored them all underground in a massive hoard. They were unable to change, orpolymorph, their frightening appearance, so they usually visited mortals in secret, often using telepathy to speak directly in their prey's mind.

They would rather have their minions do the work if they did not need to do it themselves, and through their corrupting ways could turn allies into enemies and brainwash companions into fighting one another. However, they had no qualms about direct confrontation and did not hesitate to wade into battle, in fact embracing any chance to burst into violence.[3][2][9][12] Unlike normal magic users, glabrezu did not stand behind their minions casting spells, but ran straight into combat using chaos-inducing powers to send the battlefield into disarray.[3][2]A glabrezu's normal strategy in combat was to use theirconfusionspell-like ability before usingchaos hammerorunholy blightto finish off wounded foes.

Under normal circumstances they never traveled together, and seeing multiple at once was likely the result of theirmirror imageability.[9] Demonic opinions on the glabrezu varied depending on who was asked, although most lesser demons likechasmesanddretchesrightfully feared them.[13]Mariliths, on the other hand, were dismissive and hateful towards the glabrezu despite their mutual love of planning. While glabrezu favored subtlety and temptations, mariliths felt these games were inferior to true warfare and would prefer to wipe the glabrezu out completely, settling for attempts to discredit them to higher-ups.

In part because of their height and lean musculature, gnolls were very quick compared with many other races such ashumans.[7]Gnoll skin was greenish-gray, and their furry hide a light or dark brown hue, sometimes marked with spots or stripes. Many gnolls also had a dirty yellow to a reddish-gray crest-like mane that stood on end when they were angry.[7] It is believed by some that gnolls had traces ofdemonicblood, which may be evidenced by unusual features found among some of the gnoll bloodlines. These may have included talons, gleaming red eyes, or black fur with fiery orange spots.[7] Female gnolls were indistinguishable from males by size, in spite of a reputation for being shorter. In fact, so similar were male and female gnolls in appearance that they were often mistaken for one another. The only reliable way to tell the difference, other than through a close physical examination, was if a female was pregnant or openly nursing.[11] Gnolls had very short lifespans when compared with other sapient humanoids, living only 30 or so years on average and maturing to adulthood at a remarkable speed. Gnolls did not, however, age particularly dramatically except at the end of their lifespans, at which point the decline quickly ended in their death.[7]When a gnoll died, its bones were occasionally harvested by the other gnolls and animated by rituals into awitherling, a type of skeletal gnoll.[12]","5eR5e4e3e2e1eVarious depictions of gnolls.Gnoll5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[1][2]SizeMediumTypeHumanoidTag(s)GnollAlignmentChaotic evilChallenge ratingGnoll1⁄2Pack lord2Fang of Yeenoghu4Hunter1⁄2Flesh gnawer14th Edition Statistics[3]SizeMediumOriginNaturalTypeHumanoidAlignmentChaotic evil3rd Edition Statistics[4]SizeMediumTypeHumanoidSubtype(s)GnollAlignmentUsuallychaotic evilChallenge rating12nd Edition Statistics[5]SizeLargeAlignmentChaotic evil1st Edition Statistics[6]SizeLargeAlignmentChaotic evilGeneral InformationPatron deityYeenoghu[4]VisionDarkvision,[1][4]low-light vision[7]Average lifespanUsually up to 30 years[7]Language(s)Gnoll[1][4]SubracesFlind[8]Favored climateWarm[4]Favored terrainPlains[4]AppearanceAverage height7' – 7'6""[7]Average weight280 – 320 lbs.[7]Skin color(s)Greenish-gray[7]Hair color(s)Light or dark brown fur marked with spots and stripes, dirty yellow to reddish gray mane[7]DistinctionsHyena-like appearance,[4]combative personality,[9]demonicbloodlines[7]HistoryFirst appearanceDungeons & Dragons(1974) boxed setBased onLord Dunsany'sgnole(fromThe Book of Wonder), a cross between agnomeand atrollGnollswere ahumanoidrace that most closely resembled human-hyena hybrids withinFaerûn.

Fortunately, such creatures were rarely seen united and, although gnolls as a whole have had a strong affinity for family and blood ties, this friendliness was not often extended to those who belonged to a different pack; the race has commonly made war on itself.[15]Some gnolls could suffer from a rare form of madness that could quell their intense hunger and evil instincts, causing guilt for their misdeeds and a pacifistic nature.[16] Other gnoll practices might have seemed equally strange, such as the gnoll propensity for scavenging. At its most basic level, this tendency led many gnolls to collect trophies that remind them of past victories, items sometimes grisly though just as often simple and mundane.[7]Gnoll trackers have used this to their benefit, keeping scraps of clothing or other objects with the scent of their prey on them, which they have used to point them in the direction of their quarry.[17] Gnolls in the middle of razing a village to the ground. This tendency led to the even more alien gnoll practice of carrion-eating. Unlike most races, gnolls had few, if any, qualms about eating the dead of other races. When gnolls struck a village, they did not only leave no survivors but nocorpses, eating most of those whom they did not take as slaves. There were even indications that some gnolls took this practice a step further, raiding graveyards for fresh corpses on which to feed.[11]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Gnolls were often known to fight withbattleaxes,great bows,morningstars, various types ofpole arms, andtwo-handed swords.[6]","NOT FOUND","A gnoll flesh gnawer.","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","In spite of the savage nature of the gnolls, there were some aspects of their culture that were not inherently repulsive. Gnolls placed a very strong value on the family, for instance, respecting blood ties perhaps more than any other aspect of a relationship. Though gnolls within a pack commonly fought with each other for dominance, these battles were quickly forgotten after their resolution, and in most situations, gnolls of the same bloodline were loyal friends and allies to one another.[7]These bloodlines were almost always traced maternally, through the female line.[11] This loyalty to family was particularly obvious during combat, either with rival gnoll packs or other races. Gnolls who fought side by side regularly threw away personal glory in order to help their brethren. Perhaps most surprisingly, when a gnoll has been separated from clan and family their instinctive need for such blood ties has led them to form a surrogate ""pack"" from those whom they choose to befriend. To these unlikely allies, the gnoll has been as loyal and faithful as they would their own brothers or sisters, embracing the outsiders as if they were family.[7] Some gnoll societies were patriarchal and led by a chieftain, the biggest and strongest of the tribe. Chieftains were known to keep harems and as gnolls bred for fieriness, the harem-wives were the strongest fighters among other males and females, second in war-strength only to the chieftain.[18] The scavenging of wild gnolls rose to entirely new levels as well. While all gnolls had an innate tendency for collecting souvenirs and trophies, nomadic packs, particularly the savage ones who have had little contact with other races except during wartime, have found few other ways to acquire technology, having crafted few tools of their own. The result of this is that most gnolls relied on the other races as their source of wealth and technology. This extends to arms and weaponry, giving gnoll armor a unique aesthetic where each suit is typically made kitbashed together from scavenged pieces of armor found either on victims or abandoned.[9] Gnolls of all kinds have found an affinity for hyenas, whom many see as their brethren and whom they have kept as pets or for hunting.[19]Besides hyenas, they were known to keephyaenodonsas pets.[6]","A gnoll witherling.","NOT FOUND","From Year of the Fanged Beast, 640 DR, the tribes following Yeenoghu in the Shaar were emboldened to attack the region aroundLake Lhespenwith their newly acquired shamanistic power.[25] By1340 DR, a tribe of gnolls took over theCadorna Textile Housein then-ruined and monster-infestedOld Phlan.

The race was often, though not always, dominated by other goblinoids, most commonlyhobgoblins. Goblins may have, in fact, been initially created by this related race to serve as scouts and infiltrators.[11]","Like other goblinoids, goblins often had a short temper,[7]and were more easily provoked than individuals of most other races. They often found it difficult to overcome this short fuse, and had a sense of greed that made it difficult for them to act altruistically.[15]They also generally took sadistic pleasure in exacting revenge once crossed.[15] Young goblins were taught from an early age to rely only on themselves, and that to survive, they needed to be aggressive and ruthless. To a goblin, it didn't seem logical to treat others as well or better than you would treat yourself; rather, they believed in preemptively removing potential rivals before they could become a threat. Expatriated goblins would sometimes try to recreate the circumstances of their culture, preying on the weaknesses of others in non-goblin communities.[9] Despite their generally poor reputation however, not all goblins were dim-witted or evil. Some goblins have risen to become heroes, gaining enough renown to be accepted into the civilized world of other, more commonly good races. Those goblins seeking this path may have found it difficult to overcome their temper and greed, as well as the cultural influence of their brethren, but those who did often found it could be more rewarding, in the long run at least, to serve good rather than to serve evil.[15]Those that did often made use of their ill-gained talents asroguesorfighters.[7]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","A fearsome goblin letting loose his battle cry.

In combat, goblins often used this advantage to sneak up on enemies and deal them a blow from hiding and then slip away before they could be retaliated against.[13] When they had superior numbers in battle, goblins would attempt to flank lone combatants.[17]Retreat or surrender was their general response to being outmatched.[16] Goblins were often known to fight withmilitary picks,morningstars,short swords,slings, andspears.[5]","Goblins bred extremely rapidly compared with many other races, accounting for their large population.[23]","Goblins were not known for having their lives valued.

Because of the violent nature of goblin culture, it was not uncommon for goblins to come under the domination of individuals from a larger, more physically powerful culture, most typically larger goblinoids such ashobgoblinsorbugbears.[7] Goblins had little concept of privacy, living and sleeping in large communal areas with only the leaders living separately in their own private chambers. As such, goblin lairs were often stinking or soiled, though easily defended when under assault[9]and layered with simple traps for such purposes.[16]The innermost chambers of goblin lairs were usually the most densely-populated and well-defended.[17]Goblin settlements were often filled with young goblin children, partially due to gender roles, though young goblins did not outnumber adults since their lives were often at least as dangerous as their forebears.[9] A pair of goblins torturing adwarf. The gender roles of goblin society had the dominant males sustain the community through raiding and stealing, sneaking into lairs, villages, and even towns by night to take what they could (and if supplies ran short they were willing to eat sentients, including each other).[9]Goblin females meanwhile were expected to birth as many children as possible to sustain a population constantly driven down by violence. Many goblins who left for a life among other races were females, driven away by the rigidly structured role they were expected to play.[9] Some goblin tribes were not above waylaying travelers on the road or in forests and stripping them of their possessions.[18]Goblins sometimes captured slaves to perform hard labor in the tribe's lair or camp.[5][19]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Those who subscribed to this theory believed that Pale Night must have drawn some great evil entity to herself to father her children; suggestions for what this entity could have been included an evil god such asSet, abaernoloth, the patriarch of a race of immortal warriors from another reality, an Outer God of Crawling Chaos, and even a sentient portion of the Abyss itself. Some maintained that Asmodeus was drawn from the Nine Hells to mate with Pale Night, implying that there may be truth in both theories.[16] During theYear of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR, on 15 Nightal, Graz'zt was summoned to theUnderdarkbelow theEarthfast Mountainsnear theMaster's Library, due to a ritual performed byGromph Baenrethat was originally meant to summon and bindDemogorgon, but which failed and instead summoned several Demon Lords in various locations throughout the Underdark.[30]In this location, he subdued a force ofZhentarim.[31]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

The first was their entire epidermis, which acted as a single ""ear"", giving them excellent hearing. The other sense was far more mysterious, and was described as a sort ofelectroreception; a grell was able to sense the faint electrical stimuli produced by both living creatures and inanimate objects within 60 ft (18.3 m) of itself. This sense was startlingly accurate despite its relatively short range, as a grell was easily able to distinguish between two beings of different sizes, a living and a dead creature, and even tell that two boulders had different compositions. It also allowed grell to ""see"" even in areas of magical silence.[6] However, this is not to say that such a sense did not have its limitations; a grell would struggle to distinguish between, for example, two humans of a similar size unless they both spoke (a grell's keen hearing would allow it to identify individuals by voice alone).

"grung","Adult grungs usually stood at approximately 3 feet  (0.91 meters). Males were generally smaller than females. They resembled smallhumanoidswith strongtoadorfrog-like legs that ended in webbed feet. Their torsos and heads were less amphibian and more humanoid. They had muscular forelimbs and their hands had opposable thumbs. These creatures stood upright erect and moved about in quick, short hops. Unlike frogs and toads, however, grung were incapable of long leaps.[2] The evolution of grung gave them intelligence, opposable thumbs, and ingenuity, but took away their prehensile tongues, which were common among other amphibian races. This adaptation left grung with wide, sharp teeth-filled mouths. Their bright-colored skins were kept slick and wet as they breathed through them. Grung eyes were comparatively smaller than those of frogs or toads and were crowned with hard protective ridges. Their eye color was red with black pupils.[2] Grungs reproduced by laying eggs, which hatched into grey tadpoles which metamorphosed into amphibious humanoids over three months, and into adults over another six to nine months[2]by which time their skin had adopted the bright colors which would identify their castes.[3]Grungs reproduced quickly: one chieftain namedYorbhad at least one hundred and eighty children, and that was just his sons.[4]","5e2eGrung5e2e5th Edition Statistics[1]SizeSmallTypeHumanoidTag(s)GrungAlignmentLawful evilChallenge ratingGrung1⁄4Wildling1Elite warrior22nd Edition Statistics[2]SizeSmallAlignmentLawful evilGeneral Information[2]MovementClimbing,[1]SwimmingActivity cycleDiurnalDietCarnivorousAverage lifespanUp to 50 YearsIntelligenceAverageLanguage(s)Grung[1]Favored climateTropical, subtropicalFavored terrainSwampsAppearance[2]Average height2.5‒3.5 ft (0.76‒1.1 m)Average weight30 lb  (14 kg)Skin color(s)Green, Blue, Purple, Red, Orange, & Gold[1]Eye color(s)Red with black pupilsGrungs(pl:grung or grungs[2][1]) were poisonous frog-like amphibioushumanoidsthat lived in swamp or marsh[2]forests.

Some mobility was possible between the castes, such as in cases of valuable contributions and great deeds, in which case ritual magic and herbal compounds were used to change the individual grung's color.[1] Grung were aggressive and territorial. They often attacked any intruders, be they adventurers or members of another tribe. Border wars were quite common among clashing grung tribes. A single tribe usually claimed area within one mile around the settlement. The territory was rigorously patrolled and, if an intruder was encountered, the grungs never engaged in negotiations.[2]When they travelled or were otherwise away from home, they rested high in the trees by building nests—calledtunulungas—which were fashioned from their own saliva and oils.[9] Grung tribes also made extensive use of slavery, and were always looking for new creatures to enslave.[1]They held their slaves in crude pits covered in wooden bars,[10]and kept them at bay by poisoning their food in order to inflict lethargy on them. Over extended periods of time, the effects of such poisoning could only be removed by magic.[1] Leaders were always the strongest fighters[2]of the gold caste in the tribe,[1]and as females tended to be larger than males, most tribes were matriarchal and led by female war chiefs,[2]however some were led by a male king or chief.[11]One way of reaching a position of power was via dueling to the death for the title. Each tribe also had a femaleshaman.[2]","All grungs continuously secreted a poisonous substance that was harmless to them[1](however they were not immune to other poisons and venoms).[2]This secretion was quite sticky, and grungs could easily wipe their weapons on their own skin to coat them in this highly toxic substance. When exposed to air, grung poison quickly deteriorated and broke down within a minute, making it extremely hard to harvest and bottle. Their saliva contained the same but weakened poison.[2] While all grung poisons had similarly debilitating effects, each color of grung poison also caused unique ailments in their victims. Green grungs' poison restricted movement, blue grungs' poison caused prey to shout and yelp against their will, purple grungs' poison drove victims to desperately seek water, red grungs' poison caused ravenous hunger, orange grungs' poison caused irrational fears of one's friends, and gold grungs' poison couldcharmthe victim as well as gift them the ability to speak the grung language.[1] Grungs were amphibious, but although they could survive underwater, they were better climbers than swimmers.[1]They needed to stay wet at all times as dry skin killed them via suffocation.[2]They needed to submerge themselves in water for at least one full hour every day or their health began to deteriorate. Six days without access to water was sufficient to kill a grung.[1][5]","Due to their size, grungs often avoided direct confrontation and preferred ambushing their prey. The most common ambush strategy was laying camouflaged and waiting for their opponents, grung from other tribes, or quarry to venture into the range of theirshort bowsor throwingspears.[2]In addition to their naturally poisonous nature, grungs also poisoned their weapons.[1][2]If their prey survived the initially volleys, the grungs would flee across the tree tops so as not to leave any trail.[6] When unable to use their weapons of choice, grung could also deal significant amount of damage with a simple bite to deliver their less potent but still venomous saliva.[2]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","When the people ofOmubegan worshiping theNine Trickster GodsafterUbtaoabandoned them in the 13thcenturyDR, one of these Tricksters was a grung calledNangnang.

Their preferred food was freshdemihumanmeat, especiallyelves. Due to the natural resistance elves had to the harpy's song, harpies viewed their meat as an especially rare delicacy.[7] Harpies made homes in groups of six or more individuals within marshlands or in caves near shorelines, which were preferably near well-traveled routes.[6]They were often encountered alone, in pairs, or in packs of seven to a dozen harpies known as ""flights"".[3]However, a tribe of harpies, known as a ""scream"", could be as large as two hundred.[7]There was no social structure to harpy life. There was constant quarreling, which sometimes resulted in fights to the death. When deaths did occur, harpies were willing to eat their own kind. Otherwise, harpies ventured out to hunt, and their victims were often brought back to the lair to be killed and eaten.[6] Harpies were generally uninterested in treasure or wealth, but they would always take at least one possession from a victim back to their lair as a symbol of their kill.[7] A few successful harpies took up the bow as archers, mastering this tactic and going at it alone as cruel hunters, bandits, and mercenaries, usually operating as bandits when not hired as mercenaries. Such harpies acquired much wealth in the form of the tools of their trade.[3] It was not unknown for harpies to cooperate with other evil humanoids if it served their interests.[6]","The deadliest power of the harpy was its insidious and captivating song.

It took an effort to will to resist; those who did could count themselves safe for a day, at least from that one harpy's song. In those who succumbed, it induced a trance-like state in which the victim was compelled to move directly towards the harpy. If dangers obstructed their path, they could shake off the effect, but if they could not, they could do little but try to protect themselves. However, once within reach of the harpy, the victim was at the harpy's mercy and made no attempt at defending themselves.

They were tools of war that anchored armies and granted impressive artillery to the infernal military. However, though constructed for use in theBlood War, they served their creator, Mephistopheles, when not on loan to the Lord of the First for use in stemming the constant tides of demons. In this domestic capacity they were his guards, or just symbols of his power and prestige. Many devils speculated that, in addition to annihilating legions of devils as well as demons, hellfire engines were a deterrent against treachery from Mephistopheles' dukes.[1][2] Hellfire engines were normally encountered individually, where they functioned as guardians for powerful devils (though typically not for things such as vaults and hoards, as they were much too specialized weapons of war for such a role).[2][1]Devilish generals, such asamnizu, typically kept them in reserve until they were needed to repel invading demons or crusading mortals.[1]They might also be found amidst a squadron of other devils as part of a strike force, such as tenbarbazu, sixorthons, or sixsteel devils.[2]","The most noteworthy trait of hellfire engines is their namesake; created byMephistopheles, the infernal flames were not truly fire at all, but a planar energy derived from Hell itself that took the form of flame. It was hotter than any mundane fire and could burn through not only the hardest known substances, but the very souls of those unfortunate enough to be subject to it. With this, no known creature in the cosmos could resist the terrible attacks of hellfire engines. It infused their attacks, could be spew out in gouts, and radiated out from their bodies such that just touching or striking them was a potentially lethal prospect.[1][2] Hellfire engines were also known to be outfitted in what were known as ""hellfire weapons"". These included ""bonemelt sprayers"" which drenched the enemy in burning, acidic fuel, ""lightning flails"" which electrocuted those nearby those the flail actually struck, and ""thunder cannons"", which devastated the area the engine shot at with terrible force. Though not every weapon made apparent use of hellfire, death to any of them would condemn a victim to existence in the infernal legions. Unless quickly saved, theirsoulwould rise as alemurefrom theRiver StyxinAvernuswithin a few hours, and from there could only be rescued with awishspell, or atrue resurrectionspellafter killing the lemure. Constructs, devils anddemonswere known to be immune to this effect, although thearchdevilswould love to find a way to modify the magic such that the lattermost group were not.[1] Even without their hellfire and many potential ordinances, hellfire engines were still dangerous and destructive weapons. They were incredibly powerful, able to stampede over even larger creatures and leave them crushed and immobile beneath their mass. Their bodies were made ofcold iron, and incredibly durable and difficult to damage without magical,good-aligned,silver, and/oradamantineweapons. Their forms were immutable, and their were immune and resistant to all manner of powers, effects and conditions that varied based on reports.[1][2] Among the only known weaknesses of hellfire engines was that, as entities of fire and steel, they were susceptible to the cold (at the very least when compared to their various immunities) and had a tendency to explode when destroyed.[1][2]","Hellfire engines were semi-autonomous, possessing basic awareness but lacking intelligence and identity to a degree bordering on absence. They could respond to the simple commands of their creator (as withgolems) or another entity they were ordered to obey and were incapable of subtlety or deception. However, their drive to destroy could urge them to run rampant in a berserk frenzy.

They were patchwork creatures that seemed to cross traits of canines and felines, with bruised, crushed digits ending in claws on their front legs and back legs ending in hooves.

Their cowardice was not to be confused with weakness, and when they decided to go on the offensive they did so with ruthless savagery and focus.[4]The first few seconds of combat with a howler pack often decided the outcome of the entire engagement. After chasing and wearing them down they would descend upon their prey, primarily relying on their numbers, speed and paralyzing howling.[1][3]They used hit and run tactics to gradually weaken their targets but fled if their attempts to single out weak prey stopped working.[3][4] Although they generally avoided civilized areas and tight locations, howlers on theMaterial Planewere known to terrorize isolated villages, feasting on the steady supply of flesh and fear generated by the inhabitants. Normally content to drag off one or two victims at a time, any display of defiance resulted in the pack surrounding the offenders home and devouring everyone inside after crippling them with a series of howls.[2]","NOT FOUND","If left to prowl their native plane, howlers would be another blight upon Pandemonium.[4]However, howlers could be found in most of theLower planes, in particular those defined bychaosandevil, captured and trained by those that had learned to tame them.[1][3]Quasits, abyssalorcsandsuccubiwere known to use howlers as mounts and pack animals while largerdemonsused them as hunting hounds.[3]They were just as powerful as draft horses and far more capable of traversing Pandemonium's tunnels, making them far more effective steeds.[4]Although their abilities were less effective againstoutsiders, howler packs were commonly deployed in theBlood Wardue to their ability to neutralize the enemy for a few precious seconds.[1] Domesticating them was a serious ordeal requiring the howlers to have a positive disposition to their master combined with a brutal period of training, until the creatures recognized their trainer as the undisputed pack leader. Bothfiendsand evil mortals of sufficient strength and viciousness could train a howler pack to show complete loyalty.[1][3]On the Material Plane,troglodytes,shadar-kaianddrowwere known to capture young howlers and train them for war.

It was entirely possible said wizards were driven to madness by their howler subjects and no language could be deciphered in their wails, whether through study or magic.

Their raised bristles, while inaccurate could break off and become lodged in their victims requiring each one of them to be carefully removed lest the victim suffer extreme pain.[3][4] Their titular howling was a horrifying sound that could be heard from a large distance, even through the loud winds of their home plane, and which caused other creatures to become debilitated by fear and incapable of complex thought.[1][3]Prolonged exposure to their baying had a similar effect to the winds of Pandemonium, slowly driving the listeners insane and turning those nearby into stumbling wrecks.[1][3][4]","Howlers were nonaggressive and usually cowardly when alone although extremely cruel when in packs.[3][4]They practically stood when howling, and likedogswould do so for any number of reasons.[4]They howled when lonely, trapped, frightened or challenged but despite their bestial behavior possessed a surprising level of intelligence, enough to understand language.[3][4] Young and inexperienced howlers killed their victims quickly for the delicious rush of terror that a violent death generated.

Imps were masters of flattery, coercing others into acts oflawful evilthrough wheedling service due to lacking the intimidating presence held by other devils.[2][9]When not outright trying to corrupt, they engaged in unscrupulous mischief, such as swiping valuables. Regardless of the fawning façade they upheld, imps were ultimately at the service of their infernal lords and viewed their worldly masters as tools.[2][4] At the same time, their obedience to their leaders inHellwas rooted in craven pragmatism rather than genuine loyalty.[10]Even though they were always at the service of another, whether a devil or mortal, imps were still independent creatures with ambition that belied their small size and sycophantic demeanor.[4]Their true desire was like that of most devils, to advance beyond their current station and obtain a position of power, and offering them the chance to do so was the only way to obtain their true loyalty, if only temporarily. When provided with positions of power, their helpful personas faded away to reveal the authority abusing tyrants they kept hidden.[10]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Although durable, imps were cowardly creatures that did battle only if necessary.[2]When fighting, imps relied on the element of surprise, first turning invisible or entering animal form. From there, they waited for an opportunity to strike, such as the enemy becoming distracted, before striking and escaping from reach.[2][3]Imps would immediately flee if a battle was no longer going in their favor, but the exception to this rule was when their mortal charges were in danger. This apparent loyalty, however, was mere illusion, as an imp was only concerned with keeping their ticket to promotion and connection to the mortal realm.[1][3]","NOT FOUND","Although they could be found throughout theLower Planes, imps were most commonly found withinAcheronand particularlyBaator.[1][4]Occasionally they were found in groups, but they were more likely to be in the service of other malevolent beings.[2]They were willing to serve any kind of evil master but could not always be relied upon to be swift or efficient in their duties.[1]When under the rigid rule and watchful eyes of baatezu masters, however, imps followed commands as best as they were able, often serving as errand-runners, spies or emissaries.[4][10] An imp serving as awarlock's familiar. Imps performed many roles in the hands of mortals, acting as advisors, scouts, assistants, confidants and, most importantly, familiars.[1][8]They typically served underlawfulspellcasters likewizardsandpriests, or anyone else seeking magical power. Mortals judged worthy of an imp received them when they cast afind familiarspell, doing so based on the misconception that imps were weak and dutiful servants.[2][4]Lacking the authority to make Faustian bargains, imps relied on their ability to persuade and their available resources to quicken the corruption of their targets.[9]Imps fostered a lust for power within the hearts of their summoners by increasing their magical abilities, either through helping them acquire new spells or magical items. Using hindsight, spying and the knowledge bestowed on them from other devils, imps obtained a large sum of knowledge about arcane subject matters.[2] After making contact, imps would pretend to be at their summoner's service while secretly trying to control their actions.[4]Imps assigned to mortals as a part of deals were in an inferior position to those able to freely choose their targets, as beings willing to summon devils were normally already doomed to Baator and the devil who made the deal would be given the credit. When stuck in such a situation imps often attempted to corrupt as many souls as possible during their time as familiars. While some tried to extend their scheming service to those near their masters, others tried to sway influential individuals into changing their society in ways that caused others to commit diabolical deeds.[9] While physically weak compared to some lesser devils, the rank of imp was envied since the successful temptation of mortals to the acts of evil was one of the surest paths to further promotions. When a devil became an imp, it was often the first time they had the chance to be directly credited for damnation rather than marked as a lackey to another. For this reason, being given the ability to roam freely on theMaterial Planeto find vulnerable mortals was a highly desirable role, releasing an imp from the tight regulations of Hell and giving them complete credit for their works. Not all souls were equal within the Nine Hells, and the corruption of an important individual could be viewed as equal to that of a great number of souls. The average amount of souls required to qualify for promotion was somewhere around nine. Imps could also be promoted due to other notable deeds such as the rooting out of traitors.[9]","A particularly nefarious imp, spying upon others. While within their natural forms, imps fought with their venomous tails, piercing the skin and injecting a potentially fatal toxin into their assailants.[1][4]If needed, however, imps could polymorph into a variety of beast forms and individuals often had either one or two of them. Such forms were physically identical to normal animals and still allowed the imp to use their venom, although filtered through the animal's bite. Common animal forms for imps included that of aspider,rat,boar,ravenorgoat, although within raven and goat form they lacked the ability to use their venom.[3][4]Whether in their natural forms or in the form of animals, imps retained their various magical abilities. They could turninvisibleand detect the presence of either magic or good at will. They also had the ability to use thesuggestionspell once per day.[4]Imps were strangely durable creatures, healing from injuries with supernatural speed, and resisting fire, cold, poison, magic and electric-based abilities. Only silver or enchanted weapons were effective against an imp.[1][4] So long as an imp served as afamiliarits master obtained certain benefits through the imp sharing its power. A telepathic link was established between the two so long as they were only a mile apart, allowing the caster to share senses with the imp, including itsinfravision, and empowering the master's spellcasting abilities. An imp closer to its master also granted them their regenerative abilities and resistance to magic.[4][5]On the other hand, an imp separated from their master became weaker than normal, and the death of the imp could cause them to take a severe loss in ability. When serving as familiars imps were also given the power to request wisdom from thearchdevils, contacting them to ask six questions with a power similar to thecommunespell.[5]The bond between an imp familiar and its master was established through a contract and violating the services of the deal caused an imp to retract its service and all benefits thereof.[1]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Safely ensconced inside the host body, it could not be easily attacked or targeted itself. It could only be removed by aprotection from evil and good. However, this process killed the host body unless the original brain was somehow restored within a few seconds.

If harmed, travelers would find one of its rare positive traits; the riotous abundance of life in Shedaklah infused it withpositive energy, quickly undoing ordinary injuries.[18][6] It was incredibly difficult to tell areas in Shedaklah apart, but there were some distinctive regions, such as a floating, 30-foot-wide gelatinous orb in its center that served as a portal to theSwamp of Oblivion.[19]There was also Juiblex's Grasp, a shallow bay of ooze overlaying a hidden mushroom forest where travelers could trip, accidentally fall into a vicious undertow or riptide, and be transported to some unknowable location hundreds of feet away in just a few seconds, possibly to never be seen again.[20] Many of Shedaklah's denizens were, predictably, demons,vrocksthat plagued the skies, and hezrous which stalked the bogs, althoughchasmesandrutterkinwere also present and variousooze para-elementals,slaadi, swamp monsters, plant creatures, and fungal entities also lurked within it. Surprisingly, some of the less common monsters in the swamp were actually oozes, a result of Juiblex's archrival,Zuggtmoy.[20][18]","It was rare for Juiblex to actually affect the world outside his Slime Pits in any significant way; he never ventured to the Material Plane, nor waged war against his Abyssal enemies,[4]and his surging presence in the upper realm of Shedaklah was more an act of opportunistic infection than a tactical choice.[6]If he decided to wander, he left slime trails that would grow into various oozes and he would influence the slimes around him, but these were also merely natural, or rather unnatural, processes caused by his presence.[1][17]Normally, he just stewed in his domain, enjoying the presence of his amorphous kin, breeding new oozes and releasing plagues.[4][8] That wasn't to say that Juiblex had no plans or agendas, simply that he was patient and subtle enough that he didn't achieve them quickly or obviously. Though he did wish to defeat Zuggtmoy, he didn't feel that conscious effort was needed to do so or that he should feel incited by her taunts. Instead, Juiblex waited, slowly but steadily accumulating more and more power, sometimes taking small steps to further his master plan but never in such a way as to provoke too much attention. He believed that the multiverse was his to claim and he would do so when he decided he was ready.[4]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Juiblex's mind was beyond the comprehension of mortals and alien by the standards of demons; conforming to no standards, it acted with unknowable purpose.[4][8]Contrary to what one might assume of the Father of Slime based on the mindlessness of his spawn, he was an incredibly knowledgeable being of frighteningly vast intellect that moved with caution and subtlety while manipulating his minions with chess master prowess. The eldritch entity also knew thetrue namesof eachobyrith, coupled with an intuitive sense of their goals, and was one of the few beings that understood the true purpose of theAbyss.[4] Ironically, regarding Juiblex's own goals, he was possibly the easiest of the demon lords to understand purely because his desires were so simple and uncomplicated. Rarely did he need to bother plotting and planning because he was normally content just to continue existing, his only active goal being the corrosion of anything he could reach.[6][3]The malevolent monstrosity cared little for intrigue and hated practically everything, perhaps enjoying only the act of destruction, and occasionally rumbling with some approximation of amused laughter with his more sadistic moves.[6][4] If Juiblex could be said to have a grander, more philosophical mission, then it would be his ordinary goal on a greater scale, to dissolve all living things, flooding all of existence in his pestilent putrescence[4][7][15]and leaving his shapeless reflections as the only remaining lifeforms.[13]Relatedly, Juiblex was something of a recluse, rarely leaving his lair and reacting with violent anger at any intrusion.[10][16]The oozes and slimes he surrounded himself with were the only beings that interested him outside of the context of consumption and corruption, and his viscous subjects quivered with something akin to pleasure when their Faceless Lord was near.[4]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Juiblex's true origin was unknown, although there were many theories about where the Indescribable Darkness originally came from. At earliest, he was one of the original tanar'ri, somewhere around the age of Demogorgon, but many posited that he was far older than that.[29]The obyrith lordsDagonandPazuzususpected that Juiblex was himself an obyrith lord who was mostly destroyed byTharzidun, gradually declining in importance until eventually becoming an ancient relic of the past.[4]Some cited the presence of certain obyriths on Juiblex's plane as a sign that he came before the tanar'ri, although this wasn't concrete evidence.[30] According to the research of some, Juiblex was originally just part of theElemental Chaos, part of its raw essence until the appearance of Tharzidun. When Tharzidun first planted the seed of evil, it wounded the Elemental Chaos, and at the direct site of the wound was the first mass of infection, a black, bilious collection of fluids and solids awakened to wicked self-awareness. Dark knowledge rushed into his newly formed mind as he welled up, but after the obyriths began to emerge from the Abyss, he fled deeper inside to escape the conflict, coming to grips with his new existence, reflecting upon his home and contemplating his purpose while creating new oozes wherever he went.[4]Still, some theories suggested that he could be even older than that, that he was a being from beyond any of the planes that found its way into the Abyss and settled there.[7] Regardless of what was true, for as long as Juiblex had existed, he had stayed out of the conflicts by the rest of demonkind, presuming of course that he was present. He was said to have witnessed the Abyss' beginning, the emergence of obyriths, and the final battle between them and Tharzidun, but he avoided the long conflict the entire time, secluding himself in Shedaklah shortly after the war ended to drink from the Abyss and bloat himself with its power and knowledge. He did not defend his home against the gods during theDawn Waror whenAsmodeussupposedly fell and took a sliver of its original shard, nor did he fight for it alongside theQueen of Chaosduring theAge of Agesor involve himself in the more recentBlood Waragainst the devils. While others throughout the history of the Abyss and those surrounding it rose and fell, the Faceless Lord always remained in the background, preparing to consume all reality, knowing the true nature of the Abyss and fully intent on fulfilling his discovered purpose.[4] Juiblex's only consistent opposition against this goal was Zuggtmoy, who, for her faults, had ways of keeping Juiblex in check. Once, centuries ago, the Queen of Decay used a series of potentdivinationsto determine Juiblex's exact location, erected a series ofadamantineplinths throughout Shedaklah, and then triggered a ritual to banish Juiblex somewhere else in the multiverse. Fortunately for Juiblex, this plan only partially worked, but fortunately for everyone else, the partial success was enough to separate a portion of him from his whole, the unnecessary expenditure of power being something he tried to avoid. Part of his polluted essence was sent to the Elemental Plane of Water but was too toxic to be permanently stored there, so its inhabitants banished it once more to its owndemiplane. That demiplane would become known as the Demiplane of Filth and a shard of his essence would become the Hermit. Despite the many failings of the project, it demonstrated Juiblex's seemingly inevitable descent was not as predestined as he would want.[5]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Coating their rubbery skin and piscine scales was a layer of slippery slime that gave their bodies a glimmering sheen. Normally the only clothing that they wore wereleatherstraps to hold their gear since their slime made conventional armor and leather highly uncomfortable although some donned armor made of seashells.

Kuo-toa were not all necessarily evil, but within their repressive theocracy, common kuo-toa did not possess anywhere near enough willpower to oppose the ruling castes.[15] While the bloodthirsty rulers of their kind commonly fit the loathsome image their kind invoked,[15](with around 40-50% of the race beingneutral evil)[4][16]the silent majority of them lacked the same cruel zeal, conforming to peer pressure and fear of abuse more than anything else.

Because of their use of slave labor, they commonly employed nets, harpoons, andpincer stavesin order to capture their enemies. They could also secrete an adhesive oil, which they applied to their shields, causing weapons that struck them to become stuck.[2]","NOT FOUND","A kuo-toa whip. Kuo-toa societies were oppressive feudal theocracies ruled by a Vi-Poolgol, which translated to ""priest-king"", and nine Oorg-Poolgoopan, also known as ""priest-dukes"". The priest-dukes formed a religious governing body known as the Sunken Council, which exercised complete control over the citizens' lives. Each council member dictated a different element of kuo-toa society, with dukes for fishing, trade, war, agriculture, mining,pilgrimage, sacred sites,slavery, and child-rearing. While the king and dukes theoretically held absolute authority over their subjects, the kuo-toan propensity for madness forced noble elites to forge alliances with other elites to mitigate infighting. Directly below the priest-dukes were the Ba-Poolgol, priest-princes who might rule over smaller cities. Some kuo-toan elites possessed concubines, who were indolent members of the opposite gender.[19] Serving under the kuo-toan nobility were the Vi-Plagoop and the Ba-Plagoop, inquisitor rogues and normal priests known as the Eyes of the Priest-King and Pincers of the Priest-King, respectively. Handling sacrifices were a lesser caste of priests known as lashes, who specialized in lightning abilities.[19]Enforcing the authority of the Sunken Council upon the fragmented kuo-toa communities were the Va-Scour, otherwise known as whips, fanatics who inspired the kuo-toan militia to fight fervently for the archpriests and their gods.[20]Their power was bestowed on them by archpriests rather than their own belief energy. Whips were normally only the children of archpriests, and would fight to the death for the honor of taking his place after his expiration, although whips who displeased their masters could be stripped of their divine power and even killed.[2] Blib-sanvu, more commonly known as monitors, were an order of celibate, elite warrior-monks who acted as the secret police of kuo-toan society, whose duties involved the culling of the weak as well as the killing and subduing of the criminal and insane. The monitors practiced a special kuo-toan type of martial art that involved the exercise of mental control and channeling their inner madness through their fists and into their opponents. Other techniques applied by monitors included the smearing of adhesive with their strikes and lunging with abnormal speed for a kuo-toa.[12]Both whips and monitors underwent heavy mental exercise to reduce their capacity for madness.[3] Whips and monitors were assisted by elite warriors called harpooners, whose job it was to assist in the capture and confinement of crazed citizens using their harpoons, although they were just as capable of using them to fight invaders.[12]Other warriors included cutters and drowners, kuo-toa rogues who used subterfuge and secrecy to do combat and who typically served purely offensive roles in the hierarchy. Kuo-toa who succumbed to madness were captured, with violent ones exiled to regions outside of a settlement to act as a first line of defense, or ushered inside holding cells built into walls of defensive positions to act as disposable shock troops. There also existed kuo-toa marauders, those with slight taints of madness who hunted the Underdark for creatures to enslave and sacrifice.[12] Common kuo-toa performed menial labor, such as fishing, farming, or guard duty, although without supervision by a whip or monitor they would normally flee dangerous combat situations. Gogglers were excellent fishermen, capable of diving deep to collect mollusks, crustaceans, and fish from the depths of their pools. Although a diet of flesh was preferable, they were equally capable of living off of plant matter and would create fields of mushrooms and kelp lit by phosphorescent fungi that were tended to by slaves. Due to their poor mining skills, they would employ slave labor in order to conduct mining operations. While they possessed a mild fondness of gemstones, they much preferred sacred relics,shells, orpearls, and would gladly trade the former to obtain any of the latter.[20][18] Within the rigid caste system of the gogglers, those of higher status were fanatically fawned over while inferiors were treated like slaves. Even fingerlings felt the bindings of the caste system, with normally only noble spawn becoming priests or monitors, and young ones grouped in pens sorted by gender, fitness, and nobility. However, kuo-toa society was also extremely meritocratic, with skill being a major determinant in an individual's place. Although the ability to rise and fall existed, superiority itself gave individuals the right to lord over others, which was where its true rigidity laid. It was common for kuo-toa to plot against their superiors in order to gain an edge against them, even planning to kill them, although the monitors usually kept the latter from happening.[12] The primary flaw in their system was a combination of the kuo-toa's own propensity towards insanity and the structure of the justice system. Because the system was designed not to remove those unfit for power, nobility suffering from madness of their own would retain their positions, forcing monitors to apply interpretation to their teachings, with some monitors becoming inefficient themselves because of their own mental disorders.[18][21]","Kuo-toa were an amphibious race, capable of operating with equal or greater mobility underwater as they could on land. The slime produced by their skin was also fairly useful, partially protecting them from poisons and allowing them to wriggle free of most attempts to restrain them.[2]The kuo-toa possessed incredible monocular vision capable of perceiving invisible or even ethereal creatures when they moved, although their time in theUnderdarkrendered it poor aboveground.[18] Blibdoolpoolp granting powers to one of herkuo-toafollowers. The psychic damage inflicted by theillithidsrendered the kuo-toa mad, but had another, unintended side-effect. In their insane state, the kuo-toa invented gods of their own to protect themselves from the threats they constantly faced. The subconscious energy of belief of enough kuo-toa simultaneously was actually capable of causing the entity to manifest in reality. This subconscious power allowed the kuo-toa to draw power from their own belief in said entity, giving them access to a kind of divine power. The more powerful the gogglers' belief, the greater their abilities, with some individual priests being capable of causing supernatural events.[2]Two priests working in concert could achieve effects like creating blasts of lightning.[14] A dangerous ability the kuo-toa possessed was the contagious nature of their madness. Possibly owing to their mental abilities or simply their weak wills, the initial break of a kuo-toa's mind had a 10% chance of causing other gogglers around them to suffer from similar episodes. Even though madness contracted this way was confined to temporary breaks in anyone but the first victim, this was still a very dangerous phenomenon. If not culled or detained quickly, the madness could swiftly infest the entire community, sending it spiraling into chaos, not to mention potentially freeing slaves and killing important leaders.[12]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Blibdoolpoolp's form manifesting from a worshiper. Kuo-toan history was difficult to compile as the race had existed long before human recordings,[18]although various legends suggested that they were distant relatives of thelocathahs[18][32]andmorkoths.[32][33]One theory as to their origin that was widely embraced by many scholars inFaerûnas a ""fact"", but largely dismissed by the scholars ofSerôs, suggested that all three had a common ancestral race that was created through a magical fusion of fish and human slaves for the purposes of gathering food and treasures beneath the sea. Who exactly was responsible for their creation varied significantly, with suggested identities for the creators ranging the gamut ofdragons, theImaskar Empire, theNetherese Empire, the God-Kings of theOld Empires, or in someway all of them. This common ancestor was said to have dived deep into the depths of theInner Seawhere they discovered a group ofdark godsthat promised them power and freedom from those who subjugated them in return for worship.[32]Some legends suggested that this occurred in theTrench of Lopok.[33]The dark gods were then said to have transformed these ancestral fishmen into the first kuo-toans and morkoths, though some variations of the story claimed thatixitxachitlsandselkieswere also created from this.[32] Another theory suggested that they were descended from or creations of theBatrachi.[34] Beyond their initial creation, some legends spoke of ancient kuo-toans establishing an empire on the surface,[2]before being driven back by humans and demihumans.[2][35]Others thought that land-dwelling, but sea-modified races like thesea elvesdrove them to near extinction and toppled their underwater empire. It was likely that both were true, with man-kind's growing power and numerous surface world allies wiping out the initial invasion and those that sought refuge in the seas being killed by the various monsters that swam within it.[18]Notably, there existed certain ancient kuo-toa tribes that dwelt in the open depths of the ocean who had never heard of Blibdoolpoolp.[25]This was of particular note, given theories in thePresent Agethat the kuo-toa invented deities after being mentally broken to protect themselves from a hostile world.[2] In recorded history, by the end of theSecond Serôs Warbeneath the Inner Sea in−8212 TS (−8282 DR), theKuo-Toan Consortiumshad been wiped out. On thePlains of Duna, their cavern cities all collapsed and the kuo-toa there were slaughtered. This genocide left them still practically extinct in the Inner Sea until the 14thcentury DR.[36][37]Some of the kuo-toa of the Inner Sea fled to the depths surrounding theAglarondan Peninsula,[18]while others fled through the theTunnels of Iratisand eventually founded the city ofLeshnymul.[38] Either way, the kuo-toa were forced to reside in Underdark caverns and continue their empire within its murky depths. The kuo-toan version of this tale had the gogglers leave their ancestral domains. During this migration, the gogglers encountered something that drove most of their race mad.[5][18]By some accounts it was the mental domineering illithids, who enslaved and mentally mangled the minds of the kuo-toa race. With the race rendered useless as servants for their lack of sanity, the illithids abandoned them,[5][35]and it was for that reason kuo-toa would kill them on sight.[5] Other reasons for the widespread madness of the kuo-toa included mental domination by other eldritch monsters,[5]such as enslavement by morkoths,[18]genetic degradation due to inbreeding, the dark rituals made to their mad gods, the mental strain caused by constant suspicion and brutality, and the spread of insanity like a disease in their communities. A similar racial hatred existed between the gogglers and the drow, although mitigated by the drow's possession of useful trade goods. It was theorized by many that one of the primary reasons that neither of the three races had attempted a large-scale invasion of the unsuspecting surface was that they were locked in constant battle against one another.[5] Their empires entered a state of decline and only a few of their once great cities remained with other kuo-toa forced into hiding in small underground oases.[18]Some of their cities wereSloopdilmonpolp, the City of Pools;[39][40]Looblishar, the City of Welcome Darkness;[41]and the magocratic Arcanum ofOlleth.[31]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

"leucrotta","Seemingly patchwork in bodily structure, a leucrotta's form was composed of the parts of a wide variety of animals. Their heads were low-slung, wedge shaped and similar in appearance to that of a giantbadger. Their body was 9 ft  (2.7 m) long and seemed to be a cross between astagand ahyena. Deer-like legs ending in cloven hooves were far more concrete in their resemblance, but nonetheless made it impossible to distinguish between the tracks of a leucrotta and a stag.[2][1]Ending the mismatched creature's form was a tuftedlion-like tail. Male and females were indistinguishable without an in-depth examination.[7]The laughter of a leucrotta was made distinctive, as it was a cross between hyena andhuman.[6] The patchwork features of leucrottas did not make their hideous appearance inevitable. In fact, a leucrotta could be a handsome, and even a humorous looking beast if those were its only traits. Instead, the horrible appearance of the leucrottas was a result of their more off-putting characteristics, such as their glowing red eyes, constant drooling, and jagged bony ridges in place of teeth. Other eerie features were their oily, putrid, skin that was colored a motley of black, gray, and brown.[3]The notably noxious stench that hung off their bodies was topped only by their awful breath, corrupted by a combination of digestive fluid and carrion. A pinkdog-like tongue further contributed to their hodgepodge physical structure.

They often attempted to make the task easier by viciously savaging prey before stalking them as they bled out. Leucrottas went on the prowl under the cover of night or masking terrain before rushing out at prey and tearing away at them with their jagged jaws. Despite their massive size they could move as fast as a normal-sized warhorse. Rather than finish off victims one at a time they disabled one opponent before lashing out at the next. The jaws of a leucrotta had steel plates as strong asadamantinein place of teeth, capable of ripping the armor and flesh of a well equipped knight.[7] Their equine hooves were also dangerous, able to bring down their full weight upon fallen victims or kicking opponents from the rear before making sudden retreats. They were known to carry a mild resistance to poison and diseases. While the foul stench of a leucrotta would normally give it away, leucrotta possessed the ability to mimic the noises of humans and animals. All imitations were done with an equal amount of skill by adult leucrottas and the only way to improve this ability was to learn more about their targets to craft more convincing illusions.[7]So innate was the evil of a leucrotta that many were reported to be immune to the effects of charm and compulsion magic.[2]","A pair of leucrottas charging. Male leucrottas were known to journey hundreds of miles to find suitable partners,[16]but did not take permanent mates. The father did not take care of the young either, although they did stay around while the female was pregnant.[7] Calves were born live, alone or in a pair, fully capable of cognitive function and about the size of abear. Two months after being born the mother would become more kill-crazed than normal, slaughtering anything nearby to provide food for her calf as the calf itself developed its mimicry. Young followed the mother for 4 months while learning to master their mimicry and hunting before leaving the mother after 8 months, presuming that the mother did not become pregnant 2 months after the first calf was born.[7] A leucrotta's lifespan was believed to be shorter than that of a human's.[7]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","The mind of a leucrotta was clever and cruel, reveling in murder, deception, and meticulous torture. Sadistic bullies of the wilds, leucrottas drew out their kills as long as possible, even when not hungry. Indeed hunger was not the motivating factor behind the leucrotta's hunting, as it was more out of a desire to inflict pain. Leucrottas were prone to overhunting even when well-fed, resulting in piles of carrion that only evil-aligned scavengers dared to touch. When not hunting for food they did so for sport, invented killing games to pass the time and mimicked the noises of some of their longest-living victims.[2]Territory defense was not a particular concern of a leucrotta as they wandered about a given area and would leave it without hesitation if dangerous predators, localized disasters or absence of prey became apparent. They were not fully nomadic and did prefer to frequent territory they were familiar with, but simply saw it as a convenience.[7] Being cruel and torturous beasts, one would expect leucrottas to go after humans, which would be an easy target in most circumstances. However, leucrottas were smart enough to realize the communal nature of humanoids meant that killing one would provoke the ire of others, making it a dangerous tactic. If a leucrotta did not believe such an entity had allies that would avenge it however, it would happily devour isolated humanoids, as humans were among their favorite food.[2]Normally they attempted to imitate the noises of a small child or member of the opposite sex, and failing that a known friend.[6]They did not possess an insane level of intelligence, but their propensity to wickedness gave them a sly cunning not present in non-evil entities of similar intellect.[2] One of their nastier tricks was the theft of apilgrimcaravans' torches. After devouring a few travelers, a small group of leucrottas used their torches to light nearby brushes and wall torches in order to make a deserted keep seem inhabited. They then used their deceptive powers to convince a larger caravan into entering the keep, and splitting up before devouring those they could and chasing after the stragglers. Observation of common expressions and news was also performed by leucrottas that lurked along the fringes of civilization during the night. Once, a leucrotta that stumbled upon on a thieves' den used the vocabulary it overheard to lure thieves into its traps, returning every few weeks for many years until finally being slain.[7] Leucrottas often lurked along roads and near habitations by night, learning information about humans who lived in the area or were passing through the wilderness. A more common ploy executed by a leucrotta was the imitation of an injured individual to lure the good of heart to their doom. While none of their tricks were particularly sophisticated or overly complex they were made all the more effective by their relative simplicity.[7]Leucrottas found the mindsets of humans puzzling, as they treasured secrets and gemstones over food.[6]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","DuringYeenoghu's first ancient incursion of the Material Plane, the hyenas who consumed his kills went through aberrant transformations, creating an assortment of bizarre and fiendish monstrosities.

P. Lovecraft'slich(in ""The Thing on the Doorstep"") and Gardner Fox's sorcerer (in ""The Sword of the Sorcerer"")Alich(pronounced: /lɪtʃ/litch[7][8]), sometimes called alichnee,[9]was an almost universally nefarious form ofundeadspellcaster of great power, usually awizard, but also possibly asorcerer,warlock, orcleric.[2][4][5][10]Liches were feared by mortal beings for their mastery of malign magic, their intelligence, and their willingness to embrace undeath for a chance to live forever—or rather, toendureforever.[4][11][12]Lichdom was arguably the most powerful known form of undeath.[5]","A lich grows bored after eons of study. Those spellcasters who sought immortality through lichdom tended not to do so merely for fear of death,[16]but to buy themselves limitless time to pursue their own ambitious goals. Thus, they discarded any mortal connections in favor of a solitary existence, generally to pursue magical power and knowledge.[5][17] The hallmark of a lich was that it had tethered itssoulto thePrime Material plane,[1][18]and as a result, most liches retained much of the personality and even emotions that they had in life, at least at first. However, countless years of undeath caused memories to fade and the mind to twist.[19]Eventually, a lich lost all shreds of its humanity.[16] The state of existing as a lich was not a pleasant one,[11]and a lich was able to maintain its existence only through sheer force of will. However, over time this willpower warped into an obsessive drive to become more and more powerful.[5]Many soon appeared borderline insane in their hunger to acquire arcane secrets.[2][4]This fixation would often lead a lich to outright forget about its former life, and most liches reached a point at which they abandoned their real names in preference for ominous titles and pseudonyms. Perhaps because of this effort to bury their old identities, it was said that speaking a lich's true name could confer power over it[5]and reminders of its past life were a good way to get its attention.[1] Liches were often proud and arrogant,[20]demanding the subservience of all those around them.[21]Many were also cold, scheming, and exceptionally cunning.[1][2][12]They cared only for their own affairs and usually paid little heed to the living unless their own activities were disrupted or some major event caught their attention. Contrary to popular belief, most did not have explicitlyevilgoals. Technically, a lich might ascribe to any alignment, however because they were so completely detached from any sense of mortal morality, the living could generally not understand their actions as anything but pure evil.[5]Even so, some liches were known to be amicable and willing to exchange words rather than spells with mortals, or even to offer advice or training.[22]In very rare instances, trulygoodliches arose,[5]which included those who had a more noble purpose for seeking lichdom as well as those who had lichdom forced upon them.[23]","NOT FOUND","Liches often devoted their unnaturally long existences to the pursuit of arcane and uncanny secrets, making them masters of otherwise unfathomable topics likegodhood, themultiverse, mortality, and beyond.[12]They were avid collectors ofarcanetreasures, secrets, and tools, includingmagic items,potions,spell scrolls,spellbooks,staves, andwands.[1][4][12]They used these items extensively, and would design devious traps meant to ensnareadventurersin order to add their victims' magic items to their own collection.[10] Whatever its goals were, a lich pursued them patiently and single-mindedly,[1]usually relying on its cunning, its magic, and legions of lesser undead (which it wouldanimatepersonally).[5]Because a lich had eternal longevity, it often used this time to form schemes that took decades or even centuries to develop,[4]sometimes preferring to outlive its foes instead of confronting them. As such, most liches lived in secluded areas ofToril, where they were content with furthering whatever research or plots they had in motion.[17]","Liches were devastatingly effective spellcasters, often specializing in necromantic andprotectivemagics.[30]They were most dangerous in combat when they had time to prepare their spells and contingencies,[31]and they usually sought to pit their enemies against lesser minions and traps before they themselves ever engaged. Before a battle, they would cloak themselves in defensive spells and summon allies. Once a battle began, they opened with their most powerful and wide reaching spells, hoping to slay or ensnare as many foes as possible. They were highly intelligent combatants, and thus adept at quickly adapting their tactics to a chaotic battlefield.[32] Liches preferred to avoid fighting in melee, instead leaving that to their minions or allies.[2][32]Nevertheless, they were quite dangerous if engaged in close quarters.[5]They were highly resilient, and their animating magics also made them very difficult to injure (and borderline impossible to injure without magic).[6]Spells that sought tocharm, put to sleep,enfeeble,polymorph, or inflict madness or instant death largely did not work against a lich.[5][6]They were further unaffected by things likepoisonordisease, were difficult toturn, and could not be affected byelectricityor extreme cold;[1][4][5][6]in fact, they radiated cold and darkness, and their touch was deadly and paralyzingly cold.[1][5]A lich's bare hands could strike with magical, necrotizing power.[4] A lich was largely unperturbed by light or byradiant energythat might disrupt lesser undead,[33]although it could be destroyed and rendered unable to reform as anything but a demilich if exposed to thesymbol of lifeglyph.[34]Older, more withered liches were also particularly susceptible to fire.[35]However, because a lich could not be conventionally killed, it often fought with little concern or fear for its own safety as long as it was confident that its phylactery was safe.[2]For this reason, liches took great care in protecting their phylactery from harm, employing decoys, traps, and other defenses.[4]When put in a situation wherein it did fear for its own safety, a lich was quick toteleportaway.[10]","NOT FOUND","A spell-weaving lich. Liches rarely left the privacy of their lairs, although some would travel to places of arcane learning and masquerade as a living spellcaster eager to learn about new theories and research.[36]However, in general a lich kept only the company of whatever creatures helped to secure its lair,[1]over whom they demanded total mastery.[21]This most commonly includedconstructs—notablyflesh golems[1][11]—or lesser undead—notablyanimated corpses,[1][5]flameskulls, andwraiths[2]—but liches occasionally also worked alongsidedemons,devils,[1][21]cultists ofOrcus,[37]or other intelligent undead such asvampires.[4]On occasion, they might also make copies of themselves (known asfalse liches) to defend their lairs.[38]Liches were also sometimes drawn toatropals,[39][40]but they rarely if ever served a more powerful master if they could avoid it.[21]They were known to usenightmaresas steeds.[41] Liches were not able to sire children.[10]","The average lich was a very powerful arcane spellcaster. They could memorize and cast spells as they had in life, and required the use ofspell componentsandspellbooksjust as a living caster did.[5]A notable exception to this rule was that some liches were able to permanently commit some spells to memory, allowing them to be cast even withoutmaterial components.[10]Owing to the great depths of time they had to research and practice their magic, it was not uncommon for a lich to wield potent unique spells of their own devising.[5] Liches also possessed several unique abilities, such as being able to manifestcoldfire; weaken, terrorize, or even kill the living with a touch; drive the living into unconsciousness with just the sound of their voice; and cause fear, pain, or death with a simple glare.[1][25]Even merely looking upon a lich could compel the weak-willed to flee in terror.[4][5] As powerful undead beings, liches were potentnecromancersand wielded great power over life and death: they were able to disrupt the life forces of those nearby[1]and were highly effective atanimatingthe dead,[5]so it was little surprise that they often commanded small armies of lesser undead.[21]Even good liches relied on undead servants and wielded great influence over the undead.[23] Some liches could also regenerate,[2]but more importantly, it was impossible to kill a lich permanently without also destroying itsphylactery, a special item or trinket that contained their life essence.[4][5]As long as this phylactery was unharmed, the lich was immortal: if slain, its mind and spirit would leave its corpse and flee to the phylactery, and if the lich's old body was destroyed—such as with adisintegratespell—a new body would manifest next to the phylactery within atenday.[1][26]This spiritual form of a lich divorced from a physical body was known as alichnee, and it sought to reunite with and possess its body in order to resume its unlife. A lichnee was completely invulnerable and impervious to any attempts to harm it as it fled to its phylactery. It could also temporarily inhabit another corpse, which produced awight-like creature that could only cast whatever spells the lich already had memorized.[26]In this form, the lichnee maintained its wits but was limited to the physical capabilities of the corpse, which were quite less than its true form.[27]The lichnee would thus unerringly seek out its real body as if following alocate objectspell. Within seven days of ingesting any piece of its true body, this wightish form would metamorphize into a full lich body.[26]Possessing another body in this way was much more difficult if the lichnee was of a more goodly orlawfuldisposition.[28]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Thedeath wardspell was said to have been originally invented by liches.[58] During the 14thcentury DR, tombs containing magic items might be warded against thieving liches withhands of harrowing.[59] Prior to theTime of Troubles, it was said that a lich would weaken each time it was slain and sent back to its phylactery. This meant that it was possible to destroy a lich permanently by destroying it repeatedly, which would eventually result in its spirit being banished to thelower planesas its phylactery crumbled.[10] In theYear of the Banner, 1368 DR, the lichVelsharoonascended to become a god whose portfolio encompassed liches.[60][61] As of the late 14thcenturyDR, liches among theRed Wizardswere highly active inThayanpolitics, and took care to disguise their undead state in public with illusions and by taking more care than the usual lich to preserve their bodies.[62]Places thought to be haunted by liches at this time included theBattle of Bones,[63]Castle Spulzeer,[64]theCrypt of the Wondermakers,[65]Myth Rhynn,[66]and theSmoking Mountains.[67] During the events of theDeath Cursein the late 15thcentury DR, liches were unable to recharge their phylacteries because the souls of their victims were snatched away by theSoulmongerbefore they couldimprisonthem.

True seeing and similar abilities also revealed a maurezhi's form, and they were also said to have a faint stench of death hanging off them.[3] The process of properly consuming a corpse to take its form had to take place within 10 minutes of its death, and took 10–30 more minutes to complete, with interruption canceling the process.[3][1]This type of feeding involved completely devouring the body, and resulted in the inability to raise the victim from the dead, save for a properly wordedwish,miracle, ortrue resurrectionspell, and even those could fail. In order to advance in power, maurezhis had to consume corpses of beings significantly powerful in relation to themselves, and doing so granted them increased intellect, power, and toughness.[2]Although they could still gain new forms and memories by eating any corpse, they would only grow in power by eating similarly powerful entities.[3] Maurezhis possessed the unique ability to resurrect theundeadin their undead state, bringing nearby ghouls and ghasts back to unlife.[1]Fully matured maurezhis gained the ability to summon least tanar'ri and undead to their aid in the form of small packs ofmanes,dretches, or ghouls to assist them.[3][2]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Maurezhi shared many notable qualities with the nabassus, another type of demon that fed on corpses to gain power and served a demon lord of undeath.[3] Born from a society of elves, the first maurezhis were the corrupted creations of the King of Ghouls,Doresain.

Heinous hermits that they were, they were rarely encountered outside of their foul lairs, and in such cases when they were, it was almost always to inflict suffering. Greedy, cruel, and vindictive, meazels made poor and unreliable allies, being one of the few creatures that near all intelligent subterranean races would work together to combat. Their loathing for other beings extended to other members of their kind, and so the only way to productively interact with a meazel was to make them an unwitting pawn, else convince them to temporarily combat a greater foe.[6] Meazels themselves were self loathing and filled with bitterness, spending most of their existence contemplating their own terrible lives.[3]Attempting to adopt a young meazel, otherwise known as a whelp, was a fruitless task more likely to backfire than raise a productive member of their patron civilization.

A meazel's sense of value was strange and arbitrary in certain ways. Despite being greedy they saw no value inprecious stones, onlygold,silver, or other types ofcurrency. While they would steal things like armor or weapons even though they couldn't properly use some of them, they did not recognize magical objects as valuable.[6]Although all races hated the meazels, they had traditional enemies in theorcsandkobolds.[7]","An angry meazel. The original meazels were immune to even the most sickening diseases, and their very presence was practically accursed. A strange curse hung off them, weakening those who stood too close to them. Their very blood carried a dangerous pestilence that caused terrible pain to those they could contaminate via blood to blood contact.[3] Swamp dwelling meazels had numerous features that helped them to live in their favored environment. Webbed feet allowed them to maneuver the marshlands with ease, and jagged claws let them rip into prey easily,[4][8]although they still commonly made use of garrote wires.[5]While the original meazels also suffered from the ghastly affliction,[3]their descendants' claws spread their supernatural skin disease to others, causing weakening fortitude and movement. Not every meazel suffered from the physical effects,[5]nor were any of them actually debilitated by it,[8]but it presented them with a deep hunger for humanoid flesh.[3][5] Shadowfellmeazels were an entirely different brand of creature that lacked many of their signature abilities, although still present was their general build, hatred of others, and use of the garrote wires that undeniably marked them as meazels. Meazels from the Shadowfell lacked the evolved characteristics of the normally swamp dwelling varieties, but instead had powers of their own.

Prayers, magic, and conventional healing methods could do nothing to cure the ailment blighting the civilization. The plague inflicted terrible and near infinite hunger and could kill most people within a few days. When the suffering caused by the disaster was at its peak, a soothing and intangible voice made an offering to the afflicted. Those starved by the plague would be given access to a limitless food supply, and no longer would the people be killed by it. This deal with the devil turned out to be truer than most suspected, as the ominous benefactor who had made the offer was actually Baalzebul, the Duke of the SeventhHell,Maladomini.[3] Whether or not the victims were made aware of thearchdevil's nature and simply were too tortured to care was unknown. In true devil fashion Baalzebul was despicably true to his word, preventing the plague from killing those afflicted, but leaving them with the sores and hunger that were its symptoms. The first half of their deal was also upheld, but also corrupted in the cruelest of ways. Likeghoulsorgnolls, normal food could hardly sate the unquenchable need to consume, and only the flesh of sentient humanoids could satisfy a meazel's hunger. This revelation was found after the original meazels searched far and wide for the respite from the hunger they were promised.[3] Acloakeddagger-wielding meazel. It would appear that Baalzebul's curse was not unique, or at least was a unique variant on a type of corruption. Meazels of a different quality could be made without interference from the Lord of Lies, although their powers were drastically different. Shadowfell meazels were created when, in an attempt to escape the miseries of their previous existence, embittered individuals entered the Plane of Shadow and were warped by its influence. The intense negative emotions they harbored when first traveling to the Shadowdark eventually twisted them, staining their souls with a powerful dark energy.[2] In the mid-to-late 14thcenturyDR, an organized group of meazels had formed inthe sewersbeneathWestgate, and would attack the residents with fierce savagery.

Countless regiments patrolled the Nine Hells, whether occupying their endless barracks in the ashen wastelands ofAvernusor marching through the deep chasms ofNessus. Whether attacking or defending they could spend several days getting to the battlefield from their encampments. They could be found in smaller numbers on theMaterial Plane, protecting temples of evil or raiding the lands of the weak. Groups of two to four were known to serve as the bodyguards and soldiers of wicked wizards or dark clerics while troops of eight could mow down mortal battalions. Exceptionally evil overlords and vicious tyrants could receive one or more legions of sixty-four merregons to serve them as small personal armies.[2][3] Like mortals, legion devils required barracks, training grounds, and other provisions to do battle properly. Every day for them was the same regimented routine of guard duty, weapon practice, tactical study, camp maintenance, patrols, and other various tasks. Their strict schedules would be followed to the letter and without fault unless an outside circumstance changed the nature of their duties. Although they often carried coins they had no use for them due to their lack of individual motivation. This payment was a result of Hell's elaborate and seemingly impractical rules, forcing their masters to pay them wages they couldn't use and ensuring no individual duke of Hell could afford a legion of merregons strong enough to overwhelm their personal rivals.[3]","The connection between merregons reached far beyond simple coordination, and was in truth an odd magical link between each other. A group of legion devils shared each other's vitality allowing an individual to keep fighting far after it would have been defeated. At the same time, harming one legion devil debilitated the whole group and a truly devastating blow to one could be enough to cause a whole legion to fall. This weakness could also be exploited by forcefully separating a legionnaire from its squadron. Those separated by about 100 ft  (30 m) took a small portion of their shared power back, but if not enough remained then the removed soldier would likely perish.[3] This rudimentary hivemind had several other strengths and weaknesses. Attempts to use mental magic would affect all in a squadron and not just the targeted individual, meaning that if any managed to overcome the effect then all of them shared in its success. The unfortunate byproduct of the ability was that if no member was capable of resisting the effect then all would succumb to it, meaning a single overpowering spell was enough to fall the legion. They could also teleport to any other legion devil within 100 feet and they themselves could attempt to call in an additional legion devil for aid.[3]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

"mind flayer","In terms of height, weight, and build, mind flayers were roughly comparable to thinhumans, but it was at this point that any external comparison tohumanoidsended.[4][14][15]A mind flayer's body was, in fact, a gruesome mockery of the humanoid form.[16]An illithid's flesh, was soft, supple, moist, and rubbery, resulting in an unmistakable texture easily distinguishable from any other creature by anyone familiar with it.[4][15][17][18]Their skin ranged from mauve to greenish-violet in color.[4][15]Mind flayers that were healthy from brain-rich diets[1][7]excreted a thin film of slimy, glisteningmucusthat kept in moisture and gave off a faint odor similar toonions,garlic, or evenvanilla, although the smell was imperceptible from afar.[17]Their blood had a silvery-white color.[19] An illithid's bulging, ridged, elongated head[15][20]was reminiscent of anoctopus, with a cluster of four flexible, unsegmented, extendable, purplish-black tentacles surrounding their mouths. The tentacles could range in length from 2​ to ​4 feet (0.61​ to ​1.2 meters), appearing shorter when an illithid was at rest. They writhed and undulated almost constantly and absent-mindedly while the illithid pondered or otherwise was not using them,[7][18][20]and flexed in anticipation when sentient beings drew close.[1]They were also incredibly dexterous, powerful, and could be fully controlled by the mind flayer to perform both fine and strength-based tasks.[18][20] In many apocryphal descriptions and diagrams, mind flayers were portrayed as having beaked mouths, possibly owing to their octopus-like heads.[20]In reality, an illithid's mouth was more like that of alamprey, with a circular, jawless orifice ringed by several rows of small, rasping teeth.[15][17][18]The tentacles hung above and around their mouths[17][18]and an oily slime constantly dripped out of their maws.[4]Illithids did not possess exterior ears, rather hosting small, fleshy, ridged holes on both sides of their heads,[20]nor did they have nostrils.[17]Their eyes, sheltered by brow ridges, were uniformly pale and devoid of pupils[18]in addition to being bloated and featureless, similar to those of blindcave fish.[4][20] Illithid hands were long, slender, and lacked an index finger, but were otherwise similar to those of normal humanoid creatures. The remaining fingers and opposable thumb were red to mauve in coloration, and their nails were thick and black. Though illithid nails seemed dangerous, they were actually blunt and composed of soft cartilage, and so had little hope of being effective weapons. Illithid feet were webbed and had only two toes, which were also nailed and could flex widely apart, as if to assist in swimming.[7][17][18] Illithids were known to dress in dramatic flowing robes and cloaks.[15]They were rarely seen without distinctively two-lobed boots, which concealed their webbed feet.[17]They often wore high, flaring collars, dark hats, and various other pieces of ornamentation.[15]","5e4e3e2e1eVarious depictions of the feared illithid.Mind Flayer(Illithid)5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[1][2]SizeMediumTypeAberrationAlignmentLawful evilChallenge ratingMind flayer7Arcanist8Psion84th Edition Statistics[3]SizeMediumOriginAberrantTypeHumanoidAlignmentEvil3rd Edition Statistics[4][5]SizeMediumTypeAberrationSubtype(s)PsionicAlignmentUsuallylawful evilChallenge rating82nd Edition Statistics[6]SizeMediumAlignmentLawful evil1st Edition Statistics[7]SizeMediumAlignmentLawful evilGeneral InformationPatron deityIlsensine[2][8]Maanzecorian[2][8]VisionDarkvision[1][4]Activity cycleAny[6]DietBrainsAverage lifespan125 years[6]Homeland(s)Far Realm[9]TheUnderdark[1]Language(s)Undercommon[4]Deep Speech[1]Qualith[1]SubracesUlitharidAlhoonFavored climateAny[6]Favored terrainUnderground[4][6]AppearanceAverage height6 ft  (1.8 m)[6]Average weightSame ashumans[4]Skin color(s)Mauve[1]Eye color(s)Solid white[10]DistinctionsFacial tentaclesHistoryFirst appearanceEldritch WizardryMind flayers, also known asillithids(sing:illithid;pronounced: /ɪlˈlɪθɪd/il-LITH-id[11]listen, meaning ""mind flayer"" or ""mind ruler"" inUndercommon[12]), and sometimes referred to asghaikby thegithyanki,[13]were sadisticaberrationsfeared by sentient creatures on many worlds across themultiversedue to their powerfulpsionicabilities.[1]From their twisted lairs deep in theUnderdark, these alien entities sought to expand their dominion over all other lifeforms, controlling their minds to use them as obedient thralls.[2]They consumed their victims' very personality by extracting and devouring their brains while they were still alive.[14]","Mind flayers had utterly alien thought processes and enigmatic objectives.[14]They saw themselves as masterminds that twisted others into serving their own sinister and far-reaching schemes.[1][16]While some individuals could show extreme variance in mindset, the majority shared many common beliefs and precepts.[21] Illithids were megalomaniacal in the extreme, tyrants driven by an immense ambition[16]and intrinsically ruled by an overwhelming sense of self-importance.[22]The mind flayers sought nothing less than world domination,[16]knew their destiny was mastery over the universe,[22]and the ultimate prize they yearned for was complete dominion over all theplanesof existence, with the power to reshape reality and all within it to fit their otherworldly designs.[16]However, mind flayers did not believe themselves to be horrifying monsters.[21] In the minds of the illithids, their kind acted as agents of ""Order"", forces of law tasked with taming a chaotic and unguided universe. They saw the various races in its confines as potential thralls with no supervision, living out aimless existences and working with no direction. In this role as multiversal caretakers, the mind flayers constantly worked for what they saw as the betterment of the cosmos, asserting their ultimate control to provide the restoration of order that only their superior species could bestow to all the multiverse.[21][23] The mind flayers strongly believed in their manifest destiny, and viewed the task of bringing the multiverse to heel as one of great importance. The illithids instructed all who questioned this view to look at the biological facts, how they stood at the top of the food chain and how all others naturally fell beneath them.[23]While the illithids recognized that other creatures resisted their control, they perceived this as a natural result of reality's current state, the unknowing thralls within not knowing any better than to fight their masters.[24] Utterly arrogant, mind flayers were elitists who believed all creatures to be inferior to themselves, livestock fit to fulfill only three purposes: to die as their food, work as their slaves, or serve as vessels for more of their kind.[6][16]Even so, the mind flayers did feel a sense of gratitude towards lesser beings. In truth, they truly appreciated the ""gifts"" of those they feasted upon, and sincerely felt that they were giving their livestock a gift of their own when they consumed their brains.[21] The illithids had to dominate not only to achieve their goals, but to fulfill certain basic needs of their own. Without a mind to control, a mind flayer would feel incomplete. They actually had an intimate relationship with their own thralls, suffering when they died (whether by sickness, age, or physical harm) and sometimes going mad from loneliness without their constant companionship. Illithids were known to postpone their other goals just to renew an emptied retinue of thralls[23]and every illithid had at least one personal thrall. When they found one they favored, illithids would go out of their way not to eat personal thralls in bouts of hunger or anger, and might even grant them toys and trinkets to occupy themselves with when not working.[26] While almost every illithid sought the dominion of their race, each was an incredibly intelligent, individual entity with different ideas on how to make that happen.[2][27]Some would do so with military might, creating grand thrall armies to conquer the world, while others sought to use their psionics to create powerful magic items to use in their quest. Their intentions in given situations could seem bizarre, sometimes to the point of being incomprehensible, but almost every action taken was meant, in some way, to help them achieve their racial supremacy.[27] Despite their emphasis on order, mind flayers were actually incredibly competitive, as well as individualistic, to the point where they seemed hesitant to work as a team. However, while competitiveness was common, this personal desire for success served to enhance the group overall. Each mind flayer recognized that, in order to contribute to their collective intelligence, every member of the community had to obtain as much wisdom and experience as possible. When the individual failed, the community would put aside their ambitions for the greater ""good"".[21][28] A mind flayer's natural desire to compete, combined with their high levels of intelligence, meant that they were incredibly innovative beings able to come up with unique solutions to their problems. Whether using psionics,alchemy, magic, mundane technology, or some combination of the four, they were creatures of immense creativity and cunning constantly spurred on to reach new heights of individual achievement.[28][29] Most illithids understood that knowledge equaled power,[8]basing their existence on vast volumes of shared information,[30]and so the mind flayers sought to expand their knowledge in all fields.[22]They used varied methods to obtain information, always sourcing, verifying, and cross-checking acquired knowledge, for they understood better than any how personal perception and interpretation could twist the truth.[31] In their thirst for knowledge, illithids bargained, collected, interrogated, spied, stole, and plundered, obtaining their information from abandoned crypts, enemy storehouses, captive minds, wandering traders, and unwitting pawns. Through these activities they collected arcane secrets, forgotten lore, recent news, supernatural discoveries, and items of power.[16][31][32]Different illithids placed varying values on certain pieces of information; some believed that there was nothing to be learned from lesser beings, while others thought that all information was valuable.[2] Illithids had a unique understanding of time in that they only believed that the present mattered. The past was an environment for the eideticelder brain, a living record who shifted through a colony's collective memory for information relevant to current circumstance. This disregard for the past could become a circular issue; illithids did not care for the past, and so kept no written historical records of their empires or communities, and their lack of hard records made them more indifferent towards the past.[23] Illithids also had a different concept of the ""future"" viewing it simply as an inevitable but unrealized part of the present.[23]However, illithids did not believe the future (and therefore their destiny) was set in stone. For example, they recognized that it was possible for their race to die out, which would alter the future, and so complacency was not an option. Only by collecting more knowledge could the illithids accurately predict the future, and thus fulfill their destiny.[22] To non-illithids, mind flayers seemed calm and collected at almost all times, dispassionate and seemingly emotionless outside of their constant desire to dominate others.[23][33]They dismissed basal emotions like pride as fatal flaws and founded themselves on a pragmatic outlook.[30]While they might occasionally seem furious, it was difficult to discern if this was actual feeling or a ruse to manipulate others. Theories on this ranged from the belief that the mind flayers had no emotions, very few, or extreme levels of self-control, but all of these were incorrect. In truth, illithids had a whole spectrum of emotions and felt them intensely,[23][33]sometimes even behaving irrationally because of them,[30]but these feelings were almost entirely internalized and not evident even during moments of raging inner turmoil.[33] Mind flayer conclave. However, while mind flayers did indeed have a range of emotions, these emotions were almost entirely negative. They felt anger and hate when foiled and stymied in their ascent to sovereignty,[23][33]fear when faced with hostile minds they could not control, shame when incapable of controlling minds,[23][24]envy towards vast knowledge that was not their own,[22]abhorrence towards a wasteful use of thralls,[34]disgust for those that would engage with lesser beings on an equal basis, and sadness when a compatriot died far from home. These emotions, and related feelings such as anxiety and contempt, made up most of an illithid's emotional repertoire.[23][33] The most commonly experienced illithid emotion was frustration, discontentment rooted in the fact that they had not yet achieved dominion, and this dissatisfaction was a subtle, undercurrent that constantly defined them and colored their other emotions and thoughts.[23]The same principle of underlying negativity could be found in the illithids overall; mind flayers had no sense of true happiness, and so did not plan to become happy.[33] The closest most illithids came to being happy was the delight of consuming a brain, but even then the act had such sadistic overtones that it still wouldn't be ""happiness"" as normally defined. A mind flayer's highest emotional state was that of self-satisfaction, whether that be from a personal sense of pride or the satiation of their curiosity, and it was this that motivated their behavior.[33]They sought to live in luxury, to feast on the minds of well-bred thralls and master their psionic birthright.[27]Love, or even friendship outside of acquaintances, was almost unheard of, for they had supernatural means of filling these emotional voids.[35] Overall, the illithids were cold and calculating creatures[32]rarely matched in cruelty and wholly evil.[4][14]They were known to inflict pain on captives purely for amusement and force others to participate in various gladiatorial games.[6]If an illithid ever treated a member of another race as an equal, it was in all likelihood feigning friendship for its own purposes. They might behave respectfully (though never deferentially) when it suited them, but each had the instinctive knowledge that the other party would serve better as a thrall at best or meal at worst,[22][25]and chances were that by the time an alliance was formed they had already decided how and when to betray the new partner.[16] Furthermore, a major factor holding back the mind flayers and blocking their attempts at world domination were their own inherent, self-serving attitudes.[27]Few illithids truly perceived anything, whether cause or companion, worth dying over,[32]and they would rarely put their own lives at risk. Each illithid viewed its own life as supremely important and invaluable,[16]and the most minor setbacks were often enough to drive the unreliable aberrations to retreat in the interest of self-preservation.[27][32] Despite the myriad of inherent desires and inclinations that would prevent such a thing, (their dietary requirements if nothing else) it was possible for mind flayers to move away from evil. Most were simply incapable of true good, but on occasion, it was possible for an exceptional individual to change their ways to become morallyneutral, and in extreme cases,good.[32]Some were known to question the necessity of dominating the weak and devouring brains,[36]but those in a community who would deny the maxim of dominion were quickly rooted out and would be killed if discovered.[23]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Normally, a mind flayer would use itsmind blastability to stun a few foes and then drag them away to feed. Once it had its victims, it would attach all of its tentacles to the head of one of its prey. Then, the mind flayer sucked out the brain, instantly killing the creature, as long as it only had one head. Mind flayers mainly used their other spells to enslave their minions and keep them under total control, but they were also used on the battlefield.[1][4]","The skull of a mind flayer. Mind flayers were both warm-blooded and amphibious.[6]","An illithid oversees the transport of an elder brain by quaggoth slaves. Individual mind flayers were rarely found alone; rather, they were usually accompanied by two or more slaves mentally bound to them. Typical enslaved races found among mind flayers includedgrimlocks,ogres,quaggoths, andtroglodytes.[1][4]These enslaved species had in common the fact that they were not typically considered edible by the illithids.[10] Mind flayer communities (also called ""colonies"") typically ranged in size from two hundred to two thousand, and that was counting only the illithids. Each mind flayer in the community likely had at least two slaves to do its bidding. In these communities, the number of slaves often far outstripped the number of mind flayers.[37]For example, the illithid city ofOryndollhad a total population of just under 24,000 as of1372 DR, but mind flayers accounted for only about 4,300 of that number.[38] Mind flayer colonies operated as a single hive mind, with control centralized by anelder brain, a singular entity that exerted its telepathic control simultaneously over all mind flayers within a radius of 5 miles  (8 kilometers).[1]The elder brain was the heart of the community. Held in a pool of briny fluids, the elder brain consisted of all the brains of the dead mind flayers in the colony.[4]It served as the center of the communication network, relaying information received from one mind flayer to the entire colony, storing all the collective knowledge of the colony, and issuing commands to individual mind flayers. The degree of control and organization exerted by the elder brain over a mind flayer community was so absolute that it was more convenient to think of a mind flayer colony as a single individual: the elder brain.[2] Although mind flayers willingly came together to achieve an end, they were always vying for more control in the community, but even then they were always beneath the elder brain.[4]While individual mind flayers might have, at one time in their past, retained a certain degree of independent thought, after the collapse of the illithids' empires it was generally agreed upon by them that their survival required complete obedience to the elder brain.[2] Within the colonies, mind flayers organized themselves in ideological factions known asCreeds, which aligned with each particular illithid's abilities and philosophy. Representatives of the various Creeds organized themselves inElder Concords, which, under the auspices of the elder brain, coordinated the colony's various activities. In cases when multiple colonies pursued common objectives, a ""Grand Elder Concord"" was formed.[39] When problems arose or the mind flayers wished to discover some secret, they formed ""inquisitions"", a team of mind flayers, not unlike an adventuring party. Each mind flayer used its own talents and abilities to achieve the inquisition's goal. If a situation was too large for just an inquisition to handle, the mind flayer community put together a ""cult"". A cult was much larger than an inquisition and was spearheaded by two mind flayers who constantly vied for greater power within it.[4]This type of mission, which put mind flayers temporarily out of reach from the elder brain, was regarded as dangerous but highly profitable if successful.[2] If a mind flayer remained out of reach from its elder brain, it was possible for it to reacquire its free will. These so-calledrenegade illithidscould go on to establish their own colonies or, free from the elder brain's arrogant supremacy, even seek cooperation with other species. This new personality and any alliances that were made instantly vanished as soon as the renegade illithid fell back under control of an elder brain.[2]","A mind blast. In spite of their lack of physical abilities, mind flayers were feared by all beings in the Underdark because of their great mental prowess. In addition to the small array ofmind-affecting spellsthat every illithid had at its disposal to take control of its prey, they also frequently employed a powerfulmind blastto affect a multitude of foes. The mind flayer'smind blastwas a 60‑foot (18‑meter) cone that stunned anyone caught within it.[1][4] Their abundant psionic powers allowed them tolevitateat will, as well as todetect the thoughtsof nearby creatures and todominateorcharmany kind of creature in their vicinity. Additionally, there were reports of mind flayers capable of controlling others by power ofsuggestion.[1][4]They were also capable of teleporting themselves to other planes of existence byplane shifting.[1] Some illithids dedicated themselves to studying and honing their innate abilities. Known asillithid psions, they were capable of even more remarkable feats of psionic power, including telekinetic abilities akin tomage handandtelekinesis; further mental control abilities such ascharm person,command,sanctuary,fear,crown of madness,phantasmal force, andconfusion; and evendivinationabilities such asguidance,true strike,see invisibility,clairvoyance, andscrying.[2]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","The illithid race was extremely old and predated recorded history, as ancient texts that did not mention younger races already mentioned illithids.

They viewed it as an inferior and corrupt form of psionic power that should disappear from the universe once the illithids regained control of it. It was speculated that this hatred was related to the role of magic in the gith rebellion.[2] Arcane magic was especially sought out by renegade illithids looking for ways to shield themselves from the elder brain's influence.[2]Although most mind flayerarcanistswerewizards, a few were also born with the gift ofsorcery. Because a mind flayer sorcerer was naturally more intelligent than other mind flayers, it was better able to resist psionics. For the most part, an illithid with the gift of sorcery would use defensive spells such asgreater invisibilityandresist energy, as well as spells to further hinder enemies, such asray of exhaustionandtouch of idiocy.[4] Mind flayers were capable of channeling their psionic abilities to craft their own version ofmagic items. As a security measure, these items could only be used by the illithids or their thralls. They had a variety of abilities and applications, such as thesurvival mantle, which allowed the wearer to breathe in a vacuum, ormind carapace armors, which protected the wearer's mind as well as its body.[2]They also had the ability to craftpsionic seals, a type of brand that granted its wearer a variety of abilities.[43] Other items includedmind blades,shields of far sight,[2]psychic swords,psychic reservoirs,resonance stones,tentacle extensions,gauntlets of Tyla'zhus,tessadyle robesandtendril rings of Ilsensine.[43]Some illithids also experimented withsymbiontcreatures in order to create living carapaces of armor.[44] Anautiloidspelljammer, used by mind flayers to travel through theMaterialandAstralplanes.

In fact, spacefaring mind flayers were sometimes quite different from their land-bound counterparts and acted more as traders than conquerors.[43][45]However, incessant hunting by the gith and the fact that mind flayers lost the means to build them or acquire them fromthe arcanecaused them to almost disappear.[2][46]","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

"minotaur","An unarmored minotaur. Minotaurs were large, muscularhumanoids. They had the head of a bull, upper torso, hands, and the body of a human,[20]and hooved feet. Their fur and wild hair typically ranged from brown to black.[4][1]The fur often covered forearms, chest, abdomen, and legs. Males were referred to as bulls and reached up to 9 feet  (2.7 meters) in height, while females – cows, were similar in appearance, with broader hips, humanoid breasts, and reached only 7 feet  (2.1 meters).[16] Minotaur bodies were of similar shape and build to that of anogre. Their hands were huge and strong, ending in thick sharp yellow nails. Minotaurs were known to use claws in battle, but they were brittle and did not survive heavy use. Despite their heads being that of a bull, there were subtle differences in features between mundane beasts and minotaurs. Some were known to have cow-like tails; however, that trait was not common. Their snouts were thicker and longer than that of an animal, and bull-men had sharp carnivore teeth. Their canines were especially noticeable, and minotaurs never hesitated to bite their victims, prey, and opponents. Lastly, unlike bovines, minotaurs' eyes were positioned closer to the center of their faces, granting them good depth perception and another telltale evidence of their predatory nature.[16] The creatures' iconic feature – their horns – were very similar to normal bulls', slightly curving forward. Both males and females had similarly shaped huge horns. However, males' were longer and thicker on average. There were several horn coloring variations, and sometimes as many as three colors could be present. Minotaurs with dark fur often had dark yellow or brown horns.[16]The shortest horns were around 1 foot  (0.3 meters) and could reach up to three times that length.[21]","5e4e3e2e1eMinotaur5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[1]SizeLargeTypeMonstrosityAlignmentChaotic evilChallenge rating34th Edition Statistics[2]SizeMediumOriginNaturalTypeHumanoid3rd Edition Statistics[3]SizeLargeTypeMonstrous humanoidAlignmentUsuallychaotic evilChallenge rating42nd Edition Statistics[4]SizeLargeAlignmentChaotic evil1st Edition Statistics[5]SizeLargeAlignmentChaotic evilGeneral InformationPatron deityBaphomet[6]VisionDarkvision[1][3]Activity cycleAnyDietCarnivore[4]Average lifespan200 years[4]Homeland(s)Labyrinth,Underdark[7]Skullport,Undermountain[8]Daerndar,Border Kingdoms[9]Kushk,Hordelands[10]Omu,Chult[11]Huzuz,Zakhara[12]Moonseamountains[13]Nelanther Isles[14]IntelligenceLow[4]Language(s)Common(primitive dialect),[4]Minotaur,[15]Abyssal,[1]Giant[3]Favored climateTemperate, subtropical[4]Favored terrainUnderground[3]AppearanceAverage heightMales – 9 feet  (2.7 meters)[3]Females – 7 ft  (2.1 m)[16][3]Average weight700 lb  (320 kg)[3]Skin color(s)Black, brown, fair, pale[4]Hair color(s)Black, brown[4]DistinctionsFierce, physically powerful, fur-covered, hooves, horns, tailHistoryFirst appearanceMonster Manual1steditionBased onMinotaur(Greek)Minotaurswere a strong and combative race ofmonstrous humanoidsresemblingbull–humanhybrids[4]. They were rare inFaerûn, outside of their labyrinth homes in theUnderdark.[17][18]","Minotaurs were always ravenously hungry, a trait that only fueled their aggression.[4]The youth showed little affection towards their mothers and fathers. Older females received no special treatment and were respected as long as they remained strong and physically superior to the youths. Overall, their society was patriarchal, and those females who were physically weaker than other members of the tribes were treated not much better than slaves. Younger minotaurs often stayed out of the way of older males just to avoid conflicts and brutal assertions of dominance. Adult minotaurs consumed copious amounts of alcohol and dueled over most things: treasures, females, power. Polygamy was common as bulls sought to father a great number of children. In some minotaur communities, males assembled harems of six-seven cows. In some fringe cases, infanticide was practiced in cases when a calf was born with physical deformities. Slavery was not unheard of. Some males kept weaker creatures as slaves while females were put in charge and allowed to take out their frustrations on their bulls' slaves. Despite that, minotaurs disliked torture.[16] Despite minotaurs' general brutality, they had the capability to be kind and empathetic.[20]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Minotaurs were not highly intelligent but possessed instinctive cunning and were adept at ambush attacks.[4]They were particularly skilled at hunting their prey. In general, minotaurs preferred melee combat and utilized their horns for charge attacks.[3]Sound of rending flesh, breaking bones, and the scent of blood, sent minotaurs into a blood frenzy, leading to the monstrosities charging and rending any creature they saw.[1] They wore little to noarmor, even when in combat.[22][4]Their favorite weapons were two-handedpoleaxes, presumably acquired through trade. Other commonly used arms included crudeclubs, two-handedhammers,flails, and occasionally, short and thickspears. Ranged weapons were virtually never used.[16]","Closeup view of a minotaur bull's head. Minotaurs were eternally hungry man-eating carnivores. Despite their ravenousness, they could survive without food for several years.[4] Like humans, minotaurs procreated throughout the year. However, as a society, they were guided by the need to replenish their numbers rather than emotions. A typical cow produced one calf; twins were a rare possibility and were considered a religious blessing among minotaurs (sometimes an ill omen). Minotaurs matured much faster than humans: a two-year-old calf had fully formed horns and could kill an orc in combat, a five-year-old minotaur towered over other humanoids, and by their tenth year - minotaurs were considered adults. Minotaurs were capable of procreation as early as three years old in some cases. Culturally, birthing a strong male warrior was considered the height of aspirations for a minotaur cow, while a bull aspired to father as many calves as possible.[16] Some sages speculated that minotaurs lived 80 years on average, but determining their longevity was challenging as many of them led violent lives and perished long before their natural expiration. A thirty-year-old minotaur was often thought to be a steeled veteran.[16]The maximum lifespan was thought to be 200 years.[4] Minotaurs could procreate through mating among each other or with a human woman. Children born out of that union were always male minotaurs,[4]however, at least one human with minotaur heritage existed in the Realms.[23]","A typical minotaur leader, also known as the elder,[4]was the biggest and strongest bull in the tribe, which did not necessarily mean the most intelligent leader. The tribe's king led his fellow bulls into raids.[16]Solitary minotaurs were a common occurrence,[1]however, a clan could have eight members.[4] Minotaur youth were taught to fight and master weapons at an early age. In the minotaur society, combat education was done by parents and fellow male tribe members. Even while playing, minotaur children spent most of their time wrestling and fighting each other. Male calves developed brutal and cruel rivalries amongst each other from earliest childhood, and these feuds were encouraged by the adults.[16] Minotaurs were proud of their horns and often spent their free time sharpening, cleaning, and polishing them with old rags or furs. In some minotaur societies, the color of their horns determined their status within the community and attractiveness. In minotaur tribes that preferred darker-colored horns, individuals often usedoilsandpolishesto artificially darken them. Decorations were common as well.Brassandsilvertacks and spikes were used to accentuate the horns' natural appeal. Repaired severed horns were common in tribes with talented crafters or skilled allies who knew how to work metals. After a duel, the winner customarily took the left horn of their opponent, often leaving the opponent maimed and badly injured. These horns were hollowed out and turned into windmusical instruments, and stronger individuals often owned several.[16] Apart from horn decorations, minotaurs rarely wore any other type of jewelry. The closest to what humans consider decorations among minotaurs were fancifulgirdlesorgauntlets. Sages speculated that minotaurs were known to easily adapt traditions and norms from other races and societies in lieu of their own culture. Of course, those cultural norms that were aimed at aggression and intimidation were highly preferred and emulated.[16] When interacting with other races, minotaurs got along well with ogres. They respectedgiantsandtrollsfor their strength. Smaller humanoids, such as humans, elves, dwarves, and others, were considered beneath minotaurs in all senses of the word. Bulls could not, or didn't care enough to distinguish one humanoid from another.[16]Gnollsand minotaurs hated each other and immediately attacked each other on sight.[4]","Minotaurs possessed almost uncanny tracking and navigational abilities and a superbly keen sense of smell.[16]They could easily visualize any path they needed to take to get close to the prey.[1] All minotaurs were immune tomazespells.[4]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Zegdarof theEmberhorntribe.

These tales claimed that the first minotaurs were created by her to guard the Lady's many magical planar maze prisons.[21]Yet one more legend claimed that minotaurs were created by somecurseplaced on a human fighter who wanted to be ""as strong as a bull"" for ""crimes against the natural order.""

Outside of having power rivaling that of the balor, a molydeus's snake head was directly linked to its demon lord master. Through it, a demon lord could communicate its desires through a molydeus, as well as see through the serpent's eyes at any time, making the molydeus a living conduit for their master's will.[1]Besides their political power, molydei had the power to turn demons back into manes. The concept of being reduced to a barely sapient sub-tanar'ric weakling was a proposition so terrifying that nearly all demons feared the wrath of the molydei.[3] Despite technically serving underneath a balor, the molydei had the authority of a demon lord, and was not loyal to any regular tanar'ri. Even the balor they served underneath would be reported to higher officials just as easily as a lesser demon if they were believed to be treacherous. Balors, however, could try to destroy a molydeus that questioned their devotion just as easily as a molydeus could attempt to report a balor to their superiors.[5][8] Molydei were sometimes assigned a specific target to destroy by their demon lord, but their most common assignment was to roam theAbysslooking for demons to enlist into theBlood Warand for deserters and intruders to punish as they saw fit. Another common position for them was as one of the many generals of a demon lord. Thanks to the fear and power they commanded, they were known to rule vast nations of demons on some Abyssal layers as if they were demon lords themselves.[3] One of their chief, possibly most important jobs, was the protection of their demon lord's amulet. Demonic amulets not only allowed demons to be restored to life if they were destroyed within the Abyss, but also gave its possessors significant control over a demon lord and could strand them in the Abyss if destroyed.[9]When not on the job, they could often be found lounging within their specific Abyssal domains, reminiscing over their past victories.[3] Molydei were typically found alone or with only a small entourage of lesserdemons, typicallymariliths, which they enjoyed working with. A molydeus sometimes took balors,klurichirs, or other powerful demons in its mission as the enforcer of ademon lord.[2]They could also summon chasme or babau demons, with which they shared a common role of recruiting and punishing.[1]It was possible for a powerful spellcaster to summon molydei, although they rarely lasted long on the job and typically left their posts violently.[2]","Due to their two heads and truesight, it was nearly impossible to get the jump on a molydeus. Their various resistances made them hard to bring down physically, while possessing two heads increased their resistance to magical manipulation. A slew of spells were at their disposal, making them difficult to deal with, even disregarding their potent physical abilities. Most dangerous of these spells was possibly their power to castimprisonment, using the ruby of their weapons as the component. The tanar'ri they summoned were often a small group ofbabausorchasmes, or amarilith.[3] Most dangerous of their powers was the venomous bite of their serpentine head.

Largely shunned by society and often enslaved by true horrors, the humble creatures survived the trials of their lives and circumstances of their origins through tolerance and teamwork.[4][2][3]","Mongrelfolk were typically skittish, perfectly aware of their unwanted status in the wider world.[1]Those who could would hide the nature of their existence, disguising themselves as other races. Despite their pitiful lot in life, mongrelfolk were largely accepting of other races, treating all as equals and never discriminating on account of heritage, although a lack of acceptance from the world could end up pushing some to brutal acts of self-interest with a pitiless disregard for others. To better bond with their distant kin, they would often take up their cousins' hobbies, such as archery for elves, and stonework for dwarves.[3] The core principle among the mongrelfolk was survival, and they would gladly suffer through humiliation and abasement to continue living. Patience was a virtue amongst mongrelfolk and even when being abused they would wait to be released via outside forces. Mongrelfolk had a strong sense of community as a result of their outcast status and would defend their territories fiercely.[4][5]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Owing to the vast differences in mongrelfolk physiology and a general aversion to combat, mongrelfolk did not possess a shared combat strategy. They more commonly employed simpletrapsto defeat intruders but would still fight if their homes were threatened or their masters demanded it.[2] Of the few shared abilities mongrelfolk possessed, stealth and pickpocketing were some of their strongest. They had long experience with camouflage, making use of leaves, grass, and pigments to hide their presence as well as disguise their extremities.[5]","","","Some mongrelfolk possessed fangs and claws sharp enough for combat use, although this didn't apply to all of them. Other potential abilities included but were not limited to sharp hearing, flight, superior sense of smell,darkvision, aquatic respiration, wall-crawling, enhanced leaping, multiple heads, improved strength, infra-vision, larger lung capacity, flexible eye-stalks, extra limbs, and various types of tails. They also possessed incredible vocal imitation skills, thanks to their variable vocal cords.[1][5] The varied heritage of mongrelfolk allowed them to use magical equipment designed for use by members of specific races, yet also resistspellsthat had particular effects on certain races.[2][3] However, mongrelfolk deformities could very easily prove detrimental. Those without proper hands (like pincers) couldn't properly wield items. Those with mismatched legs couldn't properly ambulate, and would end up slower than others. Others with piscine or amphibian skin could easily dry out if not submerged in water regularly.[1][5]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Mongrelmen had a deep appreciation for beauty, most likely a consequence of their lack of it. Unlikehags, they did not view their own hideousness as beautiful, and were perfectly aware of their gross appearance, taking even mild physical compliments as remarkably kind. Any vaguely aesthetically pleasing feature was greatly admired by mongrelmen. Their clothing often consisted of simple and filthy robes that assisted in camouflage and could be easily used to cover themselves.[5]Mongrelmen held many artistic traditions, with music being an important one. Their songs were a combination of noises from a variety of different animals, as well as grunts and howls.[4] Free mongrelmen made use of agricultural techniques and domestication for food, and they were intelligent enough to build traps to guard their territories.[4]They would build small settlements underground, however the dangerous races that lurked both above and below would often enslave them. Mongrelmen were very easily enslaved, as their passivity and ability to endure mockery made them ideal servants for many cruel entities.[3] However, mongrelmen did not usually forge their own settlements, instead being interspersed throughout established communities disguised as other races, especially those with a wide variety of residents. Those who couldn't might still keep in touch with those who could, operating out of nearby ruins or caves. Mongrelmen with these obvious traits would make themselves more obvious to other races, so as to better the ability for less-deformed members to conceal themselves.[3]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","They were the result of an experiment by an accomplishedwizardwhose name has been lost to time.

"morkoth","Morkoth, one of the many groups of the enemies ofSerôs. Early descriptions of morkoths were vague and suggested they werehumanoid,[4]but as these mysterious creatures got involved in the affairs of other races, a more accurate picture emerged.[2][3][4]Many described their bodies as looking like gross amalgamations of various species, including such creatures aselves,humans,kuo-toas,locathahs, andsquids.[5] Morkoths had a dark coloration to their skin that varied from a deep purple to an inky black. The skin on the tips and undersides of their limbs[5]had luminescent quality, glowing a faint silver in the deep gloom.[3][5]Their heads had gills and were described as being akin to that of a locathah[5]complete with wide jaws,[2][3][4][5]filled with many sharp teeth that were visible even when their mouth was closed,[2][3][4]but others were described as having a beak similar to that of a squid,[2][3][4][5]octopus, or kraken.[5][5]This trait was predominant among those that dwelled in the Inner Sea.[5]The eyes of a morkoth were akin tofish, being on the sides of its eyes, wide,[5]bulging,[2]and moving independently of each other.[5]Additionally, those outside of the Inner Sea were sometimes said to have dorsal fin that went down the center of their back.[3] Morkoth bodies were overalloctopoidal, with eightoctopus-like tentacles making up the lower half of their body.[3][5]They maneuvered themselves through bodies of water through a combination of flexing their lower halves and jet propulsion, the latter caused by pressurizing their surroundings through a rapid intake of water through gills and other orifices.[5]Four forelimbs protruded from their midsections. While most accounts spoke of these resembling the claws and pincer limbs of alobster,[3][5]those of the Inner Sea could also be born with additional flexible tentacles or two or more human-like arms and hands that varied in their amount of fingers. In the Outer Seas, those born with the lobster-like appendages had scales along their body, while those of the Inner Sea had chitinous plates.[5] Young adult morkoths measured about 6 feet  (1.8 meters) on average,[2][3][4]though older specimens could grow larger.[2]","5e3e2e1eVarious renditions of a morkoth.Morkoth5e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[1]SizeMediumTypeAberrationAlignmentChaotic evilChallenge ratingOutside lair11Inside lair123rd Edition Statistics[2]SizeMediumTypeAberrationSubtype(s)AquaticAlignmentAlwayschaotic evilChallenge rating52nd Edition Statistics[3]AlignmentChaotic evil1st Edition Statistics[4]AlignmentChaotic evilGeneral Information[1][2][3]VisionBlindsight,DarkvisionAverage lifespan80–100 years (males)Language(s)Morkoth,telepathyFavored climateAnyFavored terrainAquaticAppearance[5]Average length6 ft  (1.8 m) and largerSkin color(s)Deep purple to inky blackHistoryFirst appearanceMonster Manual1steditionMorkoths(pronounced: /ˈmɔːrkɑːθs/MOR-kaths[6]) also known aswraiths of the deep,[3][4][5]were a cruel and evil race of aquatic predators with hypnotic powers[2][5][note 1]that lived in theInner SeaandOuter SeaofFaerun. The morkoths of each sea displayed a wide variety of physiological, behavioral, and societal distinctions from one another.[5]","Morkoths often viewed most other races with disdain, suspicion, or complete indifference.[3]Those of the Outer Seas were generally solitary, reclusive, and rarely ever congregated.[2][3][2][5][7]They valued almost nothing except food, with treasure andmagic itemsholding no fascination for them, being viewed only useful as bait for luring in their next meal or as bargaining chips.[3]While the morkoths of the Inner Sea were once isolationists themselves,[8]by contrast they overtime became more sociable creatures, living with others of their kind in a largemagocracyknown as theArcanum of Olleth.[7][5]And they certainly saw the value in magical items, often viewing them as a target during wars.[9] They were known to strike deals with other evil races, helping a cause in exchange for a slave or two. Morkoths of the Outer Sea were likely to consume their slaves in a short time, due to their ravenous appetites.[3]Morkoths also reveled in subterfuge and were likely to betray lesser allies the moment it was greatly advantageous for them to do so. Krakens were an exception: morkoths would offer to assist them in exchange for a food-slave now and then.[3]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","The only offensive capabilities a morkoth physically had was its bite, whether it was a mouth full of sharp teeth or a wicked beak, as well as lobster-like claws if it had any.[3][4][10][15] It was not uncommon to see the sociable morkoth of Inner Sea actively traveling around in groups as slaving parties or war parties. By contrast, those of the Outer Sea[15]relied heavily upon their ability to hypnotize their prey into entering their cave lairs where they could be killed without much fuss and eaten.[3][4][10][15]This lair played an important role in an Outer Sea morkoth's tactics. It was a central chamber with six tunnels spiraling generally outward, intersecting in seemingly random ways, forming a labyrinth of confusing passages. This maze acted like ahypnotic pattern, and allowed the morkoth to greatly extend the range of its hypnotic power.[3][4][10] Any creature that passed within 20 feet  (6.1 meters) of a tunnel opening was subject to an assault on their willpower.[10]If they failed to resist, the victim swam through the labyrinth directly to the central chamber, where they were likely to be eaten alive.[10]Some reports indicated that once the victim was in the maze the morkoth tried tocharmthem into submission before the effects of the hypnotic labyrinth wore off.[3][4] Being clever and cautious, a morkoth would usually only attempt to lure one creature into their lair at a time. In particular, if a school of possible prey passed by, a morkoth would only choose the one bringing up the rear in the hopes of luring it away without any of its companions being alerted.[10]","NOT FOUND","The average life expectancy of a male morkoth was around eighty to one hundred years old. Among Outer Sea morkoths, females had a far smaller life expectancy of around ten to perhaps twenty years, due to the methods by which they reproduced.[3]","All morkoths had innate hypnotic[3][4][10]andcharmpowers.[3][4]These hypnotic powers could affect creatures from a distance of 20 feet  (6.1 meters) and had no limit to the amount of creatures that could be affected,[10]though their powers could be greatly extended by designing a special form of lair (see 'combat').[3][4][10]In addition, morkoths had an innate magic repellent that had a good chance of reflecting anyspell, spell-like ability, or magic item effect back upon its caster. This ability could be temporarily suppressed by a successfuldispel magiccast upon the morkoth.[3][4][10]And some morkoths possessed the power to transform humanoids intosea spawn.[11] Due to a membrane that covered their eyes, morkoths were capable of seeing the natural bioluminescence that was given off by many objects and creatures within the sunless depths of the sea that they commonly inhabited. This natural ability was similar to the spellaquavision[12]anddarkvision.[1]They could see out to a range of 60 yards  (55 meters), though this membrane would retract whenever there was enough illumination in an area for creatures without darkvision to see for at least 20 ft  (6.1 m).[12]They could not easily bear brightsunlight, finding it blinding, and even the light of a fullmoonwas uncomfortable for them.[13] In the rare case when a morkoth had human-like arms and hands, it was capable of becoming awizardand casting spells.[5]Due to their underwater environment, such morkoth could not utilize traditionalspellbooks. In their place morkoth wizards had their spells carved into spindles of rock, which they read tactilely by wrapping their tentacles around them. As they grew further in their power as wizards, morkoths acquire retainers to carry their ever larger spindles.[14]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Generally classified as anaberration,[2]the origins of the morkoth were uncertain.[3]One theory as to their origin that was widely embraced by many scholars inFaerûnas a ""fact"", but largely dismissed by the scholars ofSerôs, suggested that morkoths, locathahs, and kuo-toas all had a common ancestor. As the theory went, this ancestor was created through a magical fusion of fish and human slaves for the purposes of gathering food and treasures beneath the sea. Who exactly was responsible for their creation varied significantly, with suggested identities for the creators ranging the gamut ofdragons, theImaskar Empire, theNetherese Empire, the God-Kings of theOld Empires, or in someway all of them. This common ancestor was said to have dived deep into the depths of theInner Seawhere they discovered a group ofdark godsthat promised them power and freedom from those who subjugated them in return for worship.[16]Some legends suggested that this occurred in theTrench of Lopok.[17]The dark gods were then said to have transformed these ancestral fishmen into the first kuo-toans and morkoths, though some variations of the story further claimed thatixitxachitlsandselkieswere also created from this.[16] TheFour ArcanaofHumbar, a group of spellcasting morkoth, got involved in theThird Serôs Warwhen they came under repeated attack by themerfolkforces of CoronalEssylof theAryselmalyr Empire. The reluctant morkoths allied themselves with the rebel Republic ofTivaanin−1452 TS (−1522 DR).[8][18] The group was again drawn into theFifth Serôs Warwhen two krakens allied withVaequiisthe Dark attacked and devastated their numbers in−710 TS (−780 DR).[19] Hundreds of years later, during theSixth Serôs War, morkoths joined in taking revenge on thesea elvesafter the fall of Aryselmalyr in−185 TS (−255 DR). By the end of the war in the−145 TS (−215 DR), the morkoth had formed theTheocracy of the Deep Onesand became a major power in the undersea region.[19][20] TheSeventh Serôs Warbegan when the Theocracy of the Deep Ones attacked its neighbors,Es'rathandHmurrathin−38 TS (−108 DR).[19][21]The war ended abruptly in−36 TS (−106 DR)when an attack from unknowntritonforces hit the morkoths on an unexpected front and routed them. But in one of the last battles of the war, an elite force of morkoth warriors defeated thestorm giantLorthar of the WaveswieldingKayas the Krakenscourge. This famed double-ended sword was briefly held by the morkoths, but the tritons reclaimed it in their stunning victory.[19][22] A thousand years later, in981 TS (911 DR), another group known as theMorkoth ArcanumofOlleth, under the leadership of First ArcaneXynakt, began a reign of tyranny over their subjects and undertook construction of theNine TowersofSerôs.[23][24] The Great ArcaneAodkof the Morkoth Arcanum ordered the kidnapping ofEadraal's Queen Wylla and two of her daughters in1399 TS (1329 DR). They were maliciously transformed into mindless beasts and sent to attack their home capital ofVoalidru. Later that year, the Eadraani merfolk retaliated by storming Olleth, killing Aodk and his cabal of Arcounts.[25][26] At the end of theTwelfth Serôs War,[27][28]around the 10thto 16thof Roamsong[27][note 2]in1439 TS (1369 DR), some morkoths allied with theDukar Ordersand various sea elves,shalarin, and even some newcomer air-breathers, to keep the peace aroundMyth Nantarand theNantarn Alliance.[27][28]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

If unable to kill anyone with their gaze for too long, they would typically retreat before focusing their efforts on an individual and trying to pick them off.[3]So long as nabassus thought they could succeed in soul consumption, they would do so, even if the target was a demon, and even if it was another nabassu demon.[1]","NOT FOUND","Nabassus were considered outcasts even among other demons, who considered the devouring of their souls abhorrent and horrifying. They made an active effort to be summoned by mortals, so they might feast on the summoner's soul or trade their cooperation for a steady supply of souls. Even demon lords might not be safe from the insatiable appetites of nabassus, as they would gang up to find more substantial prey, and even try to find demon amulets.[1] Once nabassus had matured, they normally moved into an Abyssal fortress on the1st layer of the Abyss, where they were expected to live out the rest of their existence.[3]From there, they could prey on hapless planar travelers who either intentionally or accidentally ventured into the Abyss.[2] Despite being unnerving to most other demons, the seclusion many nasbassus took part in often involved other demonic minions.[3]Although they would devour any creature's soul, they might also work with those that promised not to interrupt their plans. They ruled the nearby territory as debased lords, letting their minions take care of any outside problems.[3]Although this was normally the end of their advancement, some nabassus abandoned this role on the Abyss's fringes and pursued a higher demonic form, making them more hated than even therutterkin. Unlike most demons, they did not have to serve in theBlood War.[7][4] Not all death stealers resided in a fortress, with some working as assassins, spies, and mercenaries for demon lords such asOrcusorDoresainwho had relationships to the undead.[3]Sometimes mature nabassus would take up the wizarding arts,[8]and followers of Orcus sometimes trained asrogues,clerics,rangers,sorcerers, and evenassassins, andblackguards. The Prince of Undeath often rewarded his most valued subjects with their own undead minions and made them his elite agents.[3]","Fledgling nabassus were weaker than their older counterparts. A nabassu's very presence darkened the environment around it, which combined with their sneaking skills and camouflage abilities made them incredibly hard to keep track of. With a stare, a death stealer was capable of draining a living creature's life-force, potentially killing them. This process was incredibly dangerous not only because a victim would be severely weakened when not outright killed, but also because it could cause the victim to rise as aghoulorghast.[3]Nabassus did not just take life force; it was said they could give it back in a twisted fashion, causing someone else to become ashadow.[5]Most terrifying was when a nabassu decided to feed on a victim, consuming their flesh and spirit in a nightmarish process that caused the rest of the body to melt away. This soul-devouring process could be done within an hour of someone's death, and the soul was only recoverable viatrue resurrection,miracle, orwishspells.[1][3] Mature nabassus were far more dangerous, possessing amplified versions of their juvenile powers. They also had a new batch of abilities, including short-ranged paralysation, teleportation, energy draining, and the power to turn ethereal.[4]Once fully grown, they also had the power to summon other tanar'ri such as small groups ofbabausorhezrous, or even aglabrezu. They were also known to call incambions, a small horde ofmanes, or a second nabassu. Those within the Abyss were known to conjure a pack of ghasts to do their bidding.[4]They could also establish avampiriclink with a given target, causing them to experience every effect the nabassu was hit with.[3]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","The nabassus were thought to have been formergargoylesthat served Orcus, believed by some to have formerly been a primordial, who were corrupted by necrotic energy. In a bid to escape from the Abyss and consume the living, the first nabassus found their way to the Plain of Infinite Portals and ended up lurking around the area and becoming infused with a mysterious planar connection. This link tied their existence to the mortal realms and Abyss, ironically creating their current condition. Their strong bond to Orcus remained despite their transformation, as they were usually found doing his bidding when not hunting for souls.[2] An old legend once said that elemental spirits, in fear of demonic incursion, bound themselves to structures made by mortals. These door guardians were empowered by noble-hearted deeds and weakened by wickedness. To prevent nabassus from utilizing a unique ability to travel through their iron fortresses onto the Material Plane, door guardians kept watch over these parts of the world. If the door guardians were too weakened from acts of evil, nabassus could use these doors to create permanent gateways to the Abyss.[10]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Creatures a nalfeshnee would consume included animals, lesser demons, and most humanoid races. They did not conduct negotiations with these beings, the same as most people would not converse with their food. Among a nalfeshnee's preferred foods werehalflingsand terrified beings.[2] The second group consisted of beings that had more worth outside a nalfeshnee's stomach than within it. Powerful humanoids, certain demons,gnomes, immortals, insects (including arachnids), andelementalcreatures were in this category. Some entities within this category were of no use to a nalfeshnee, they were here because they were simply inedible.[2] Beings worthy of a nalfeshnee's servitude would have to be far greater than the nalfeshnee itself, a position reserved fordemon lords,balors,primordials, and powerful elementals. The true spinelessness of a nalfeshnee was only revealed when in contact with one of these entities. Normally nalfeshnees employed cutlery, regardless of condition, in an attempt to appear dignified and renounced combat as being underneath them. In the presence of a more powerful being, this facade melted away into a whinging, sycophantic wretch that bowed and scraped to its masters without shame.[2] Although their intellects often rivaled those of balors, causing them to view themselves as superior, nalfeshnees obeyed them in recognition of their greater strength. When their masters were not present, nalfeshnees would not hesitate to secretly foil their plans or embarrass them. Nalfeshnees carried no great regard for theBlood Warand would sabotage their balor masters even if it worsened the side of demons overall.[4]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","A fearsome nalfeshnee in battle. Although they put on airs of being above brawling, nalfeshnees were demons with a near irresistible bloodlust. When they deemed it acceptable they would engage in battle, smiting their foes with their nightmarish nimbus ability before ruthlessly savaging them while they were dazed. While physically dangerous they were more likely to be found on the battlefield soaring above the masses to target more easily defeated foes. When in the middle of combat they used their telepathic abilities to bark orders at their inferiors, all the while terrifying their enemies.[1]","NOT FOUND","Nalfeshnees were best known for their roles as the judges of the Abyss, processing damned souls from theMountain of Woethem as appropriate, a task they loved to perform.[3][7]From atop their flaming thrones, they were the ones responsible for turning the newly deceased of the Abyss intomanes, or other lesser demons depending on whether food, slaves, or slave food was most needed.[7] The rulers of the plane, aptly titled the Lords of Woe, claimed knowledge over the quality of thepetitionersbrought before them and the ability to properly assess the best demon they would make. Such claims were likely complete fabrications, as despite having guidelines, nalfeshnees were ultimately beings ofchaoswhich would whimsically promote those before them into whatever form they desired.[7]Although lesser demons were more common transformations, nalfeshnees could turn petitioners into demons such aschasmeimmediately.[8] Gabberslug, a nalfeshnee judge inSigil'sCourt of Woe.

They often obtained food from thePrime Material Planeand stored it within their pantries rather than simply eating it immediately. This food was later consumed in elaborate feasts with other nalfeshnee.[1]","With claws and teeth, nalfeshnees were capable of brutality in the heat of battle.

Their favored steeds and only desired company were the horrifying stallions known asnightmares.[4]","The dominating personality of a narzugon was anger. They despised everything—their masters, mortals, themselves, and their own immortality.[2]Their anger partially stemmed from the knowledge that their deeds were obviously wrong, or at the very least distasteful, but that they were bound by duty to see them through.[4] This sense of honor and duty was rare among the devils, with narzugons preferring action and bravery over plotting and scheming. Stories persisted of narzugons that allowed their opponents a chance to surrender or retrieve their weapon if disarmed. While the rage of a narzugon was caused by their acknowledgement of their wicked deeds, their suffering was a result of knowing that their supposed virtue as mortals was false. Regardless of personal feelings, hell knights followed every command to the letter and showed rigid discipline in their actions and attitudes.[4]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Hell knights were practically never seen without their nightmare mounts, creatures that had been captured, tamed, and bound to the service of the narzugon withinfernal tack.[1][4]While narzugons readily engaged in battle, they kept the well-being of their mounts in mind and never needlessly sacrificed them. If their steeds were in serious danger, most narzugons would withdraw, often using theiretherealnessability to escape.[4] When mounted atop their steeds, narzugons traversed the battlefield looking for a flaw in enemy defenses before choosing a target and charging.[2]Narzugons began battle by commanding their mounts to use one of their special abilities once the knight had finished their charge, a devastating attack they always attempted to use. Outside of charging, narzugons had other methods of utilizing their mounts' abilities, such as using their greater maneuverability, engaging in ride-by-attacks, and turning ethereal to slip behind enemy forces.[3][4]Once a hell knight's charge was complete, their nightmares often turned into a noxious cloud of smoke, leaving their enemies choking on fumes and giving the narzugon a chance to gain distance and prepare a second charge. A nightmare would reign in their smoke ability at behest of their knight so a narzugon could finish off an enemy themselves.[4] Against ranged opponents, narzugons fired volleys of flames at their foes while attempting to close into melee range.[4]If uncertain of the course a battle was taking, narzugons removed their helmets to fill foes with nightmarish hallucinations.[3]When fighting in legions, hell knights marched in perfect unison and led devastating charges against their foes. If on foot however, they gathered near choke points to hamper enemy mobility. A rare few narzugons practiced horseback archery, but most focused on training their ability to fight atop their steeds.[2][4] While narzugons carried different types of weapons with them, their most fearsomelanceswere those forged inhellfire.Hellfire lanceswere not only incredibly deadly, but also sent the soul of any creature slain with it to theStyxto be reborn as alemure. The process was practically irreversible  save for a quick resurrection, or the use of incredibly powerful combinations of spells, such aswishandtrue resurrection. Unlike normal weapons, hellfire lances were unique to their owners, bearing both an individual mark for the narzugon and for their master.[1]","NOT FOUND","Hell knights were the elite cavalry ofBaator, responsible for carrying out the will of their masters throughout the infernal circles like the twisted reflections of knight-errants they were. They were often entrusted with important tasks that required either quick responses or long-term solutions on otherplanes, thanks to their trustworthiness—an incredibly rare trait in the Nine Hells.[3][4]While individuals acted as messengers, envoys, and champions for greater devils, pairs of narzugons were often sent to thePrime Material Planeto track down escaped prisoners and rogue devils that had managed to escape Hell. Their other tasks might include the reclamation of lost evil artifacts, the destruction of good temples, leading wicked cults, or spearheading devilish legions, making their role similar to that of adventurers.[4] When attached to units of infernal armies, narzugons often served as standard bearers, but when organized into their own massive squadrons they became truly fearsome cavalry legions.[4]Some narzugons were members of a military company known as the Order of the Nightmare, named after their iconic steeds.[2]The hell knights' lack of duplicity made them easily one of the most valued weapons in the arsenal of a devil leader, as did the fact they preferred to earn treasure and magic items through conquest and looting rather than as a reward for service. They were especially useful to thearchdevilsof Hell, to which unquestioningly obedient champions were an immeasurable boon. Unfortunately, narzugons swore allegiance to a particular lord until death and the vast majority were under the banner ofAsmodeus, who did everything in his power to prevent other devils from acquiring knights of their own.[4]Despite this, not all hell knights directly served Asmodeus, and every archdevil, duke, and minor baron had at least a few narzugons under their banners.[2] Hell knights rarely associated with Hell's other denizens, except when commanded to by their superiors.[2]Often, their only companions on their unholy quests in the Material Plane were their trusted nightmare companions.[4]Trying to force a nightmare into service normally led to the creature's resentment, but the strong bond of loyalty between master and rider marked a narzugon and nightmare as true partners in wickedness.[1]A hell knight's greatest ally was their steed and while that was traditionally a nightmare, they were capable of choosing other mounts. InCania,mammothswere often used by narzugon elites, and inAvernus, narzugons known as ash riders mounted aerial patrols usingwyverns.[2]Narzugons were also capable of riding greaterbarghests,fiendishdire boars, andchimeras.[8]The greatest of hell knight champions were known to take even evildragonsas their mounts.[4]","Any creature who saw an unmasked narzugon would see their worst fear in its eyes. If they held their gaze too long, their fears manifested as ahallucinationthat eventually blocked out reality, causing an effect similar to thephantasmal killerspell.[3]Even their voices were capable of sowing terror in their foes and steeling the hearts of their allies.

Even when doing business, neogi were extremely dangerous due to the possibility that they could enslave their patrons. For that reason, everyone except the most desperate individuals avoided trading with neogi. However, the neogi's ability to travel to extremely hostile environments and to conduct business with races that would be aggressive and inimical to any other creature did allow them access to a variety of rare and precious commodities, so they were still sought after by greedy humanoids in search for profit.[7]They were also known for setting up shops nearmind flayeranddrowsettlements.[1] They were intensely cautious, choosing not to fight unless there was a significant prize ofgoldor other valuables.[9]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Neogi were aware that they were not extremely powerful in physical combat.

One of their favorite tricks was to allow their victims one last moment of feeling safe before suddenly reappearing, dashing their last remaining hope, and then striking the killing blow.[7] Despite being wild and roaming creatures, they were known to serve willingly as mounts during missions of malice, but only for those of sufficient wickedness and ability.[3]Those that wished to ride them would be wise to remember that nightmares were not simple steeds but fiercely independent and untameable fiends with their own instincts and agendas. Prideful and egotistical, nightmares often acted upon their own wills even if such actions ran counter to the goals of their supposed masters and sometimes even at their expense.[4][7]Even if both parties desired to commit evil deeds, their exact methodologies could be incompatible and attempts to force them into servitude often ended poorly.

Meanwhile the mares of the Abyss were commanded by the mutant mare Thunder of Hooves, a massive, six-legged nightmare that ruled through violence and intimidation. Despite their mutual hatred of one another, the two mated annually in the Shadowfell, producing three powerful foals: one would go to the Abyss, one to the Hells, and one would stay in the Shadowfell.[7] On rare occasions, somewhere between a year and a decade, a sinister night came for all beings of evil known as the Gloom Meet. The denizens of the Lower Planes, as well as the Shadowfell, met together in the Glooms of Hades to conduct dark diplomacy: settling their differences, creating new alliances, and discussing future agendas. Two weeks before the Gloom Meet began, nightmares heralded its coming, racing across the planes and becoming more noticeable throughout the multiverse, particularly in the Gray Wastes. In the final moments before the Meet, nightmares charged in a terrifying stampede towards their final destination, leaving a trail of hoofprint-shaped scorch marks behind them.[4][5][7]It was by following them that a few planar scholars and adventurers found the Gloom Meet themselves, allowing infrequent accounts of such meetings to exist.[7]","The titular power of nightmares was their ability to appear in dreams, either before the victim had encountered them in the flesh in a kind of ill omen or in the minds of survivors after a terrifying attack.[7]They could shift to theastralandethereal planes, as well as theShadowfell, at will, and despite their lack of wings they could magically fly even faster than they ran.[3][7]Their hooves typically ignited flammable objects and they could leave massive walls of fire in their wake.[2][3] Nightmares were often surrounded by a haze of smoke thick enough to prevent others from seeing them but which they could see through perfectly. They often exhaled a searing, sulfurous smoke in the midst of combat, neighing in fits of rage while snorting out the noxious gas.

Outside of their instinctual desire to inflict pain and unending quest to end their hunger, nupperibos had little independent thought. They violently lashed out at any non-devil they encountered and relentlessly hunted potential prey unless distracted by another meal. While pathetic when alone, they were normally gathered together, to clog important passageways or attack in mob formations.[1][2] With practically no personal goals or self-preservation instinct, they mindlessly obeyed the telepathic commands of other devils, making them idealBlood Wartroops. Groups between four and eight were often dispatched, but on Blood War battlefields their numbers could reach the thousands.[1][2]Theirosyluthsupervisors gathered them into mobs and equipped them for war with crude weapons, as they wouldn't be particularly more efficient with refined tools, and sent them to the front lines to engage demonic hordes. Most nupperibo mobs were under the command of, and sometimes gathered by,spinagons, yet even when directed they fought with no sense of strategy, finesse, or forward thought.[2][15]In order to use their ability to cause fear, their superiors had to specifically instruct them to focus on one opponent.[14]Unless told otherwise, they merely waded directly into combat blindly flailing at their foes with whatever they were given or tried to rip their foes apart by biting and clawing at them.[2] A nupperibo's role in the infernal military was to serve as cannon fodder,[13]acting as distractions, rearguard during a retreat, cushions to absorb attacks, or forces to occupy the enemy. A nupperibo was never a key part of a military campaign, instead only used to make enemy spellcasters waste valuable spells and time that could have been used against more important units.[2]If not given further commands, nupperibo hordes would proceed to blindly stumble throughout the Nine Hells attacking any non-devils they came across.[4]","NOT FOUND","Nupperibos were at the utter bottom of the baatezu hierarchy, only standing higher than lemures in some regards by pure technicality.[16][13]The status of nupperibo was a dead-end in terms of promotion, forcing a nupperibo to first be demoted into a lemure before they could further progress.[17] Nupperibos were the target of abuse at the hands of other devils who outranked them.[3]They were the menial labor force and partial food source ofBaator, a virtually inexhaustible resource that constantly gained new members due to frequent devilish political struggles. Hundreds of thousands of nupperibos swarmedAvernusandDis,[2][14]although like vermin they could be found anywhere within the Nine Hells. Most handlers lost them in the thick of battle. If they did return, any useful items they'd scavenged were taken away.[2]If not being used for slave labor, they could be found guarding the possessions of their handler. When a nupperibo was found alone, it was most likely a survivor of a former mob, or an enforcer or guard gifted to a promising, low-class, mortal servant of a devil. Most devils found the idea of a diminished devil forced to serve under a feeble mortal to be a humorous joke.[2]Another common use for nupperibos was as trading stock for baatezu deals with theyugolothsin exchange for their mercenary services. Whether in the hands of the baatezu or yugoloths, nupperibos were disregarded, mistreated, or consumed by the beings of theLower Planes.[14] Agelugonandcornugonsretrieving their afflicted master. A devil was demoted into a nupperibo only after significantly failing their superior, as a common belief among the devils was that demotion was the best way to demonstrate the depths of one's failures. Sometimes when a failed devil was turned into a nupperibo, they were kept around because their superior still saw some value in the capacities of their original form, returning them to their former station when it was opportune. From time to time, this led a devil to kidnap a nupperibo from its rival in order to restore the nupperibo to its previous status to gain information and/or a new ally.Asmodeushimself was rumored to use the intrigue spawned from such a tactic for entertainment, spreading rumors that a nupperibo he granted to one of his mortal followers was a former member of his court.[2] If a higher-ranking devil somehow became a nupperibo accidentally, they often left their subordinates with instructions on how to find them with detailed descriptions on how to restore them to their former positions. Such an arrangement was flawed in several ways, as distinguishing one nupperibo from a horde was difficult even for devils, and from time to time it happened that a devil intentionally disobeyed the order. Some devils found themselves working for many centuries before reclaiming their old position and if they did they would have to undergo the same horrific treatments to get their past forms back again. However, most devils viewed the chance to work their way out of the lower castes as a more preferable fate than the inherent uncertainty of death.[18]","Like lemures, they were incredibly hard to kill, as they had a persistent if slow, regeneration ability. Even when burnt down to ash, a nupperibo's regeneration ability fully restored it if given enough time. There were two main methods to permanently destroy them. Firstly, they only regenerated when within thelower planes, meaning if a nupperibo was brought away from there, it could be permanently killed. Second, nupperibos could not regenerate from wounds dealt by holy implements likeholyweapons orholy water. Another trait they shared with lemures was their mindlessness, which made it impossible to mentally manipulate them.[3] The horrific appearance of the nupperibos combined with their ruined mental state created an aura of raw terror around them.[2]When more than ten nupperibos ganged up on the same opponent, they generated an effect that was similar tocause fearagainst their target. Their fetid forms were also constantly being swarmed by vermin that stung at non-devils nearby. Provided they were in the Nine Hells, nupperibos could unerringly pursue any creature that was hurt by one of the vermin.[1]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Nupperibos were counted among the baatezu and the baatezu claimed that they were a part of their race.

Whatever the ancient Baatorians were, when the baatezu came to their lands, they disappeared. It was because they were the original denizens of Baator that nupperibos naturally grew from undisturbed larvae and were expected to grow into mature specimens of their race if given time.[9]The baatezu lie that the nupperibos were members of their race was perpetuated in order to safely turn the nupperibos into lemures and prevent new members of the old race from reemerging, with only thearchdevilsand possibly members of theDark Eightknowing the truth.[9][20]The truth that the nupperibos were not baatezu was leaked by the yugoloths at some point during the 14thcenturyDR.[9]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Most orcs approached life with the belief that to survive, one had to subjugate potential enemies and control as many resources as possible, which put them naturally at odds with other races as well as each other. This belief was spurred in part byGruumshandhis pantheon, which taught that all races were inferior to the orcs.[4] Most orcs were part of a confederation of tribes, loosely held together by a despotic chieftain. Bands within these alliances might wander far from their homelands, but continued to greet those orcs who belonging to the same tribal network as kin.[3] Eyes of Gruumshwere orcs specially tied to the one-eyed god and offered sacrifices, read omens and advised tribes on Gruumsh's will.[3] Orc bloodragerswere champions of their tribe, who used primal strength and ferocity to overcome their enemies. Most were bodyguards or lower-ranking chiefs within the tribal structure.[3] Male orcs dominated most orcish societies and females were usually, at best, prized possessions and little better than livestock at worst. Male orcs prided themselves on their number of wives and sons, as well as their scars from battle and rituals. Orcs also prized the possession of slaves, though relatively few owned them.[4] Most orcs didn't build cities of their own, instead relying on those left behind by others and improving their fortifications or operating out of small camps and dens, often in natural caves. Orcs managed ironwork on their own, as well as stonework, though their tools were often inferior to those of more disciplined races.[3]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","The first legends of orcs told of the wars between their primary godGruumshandCorellon Larethian, the creator of theelves. The elves told of how Corellon defeated Gruumsh and took his eye. But many orcs denied this charge, saying that he always had the one eye and that Corellon cheated with magic because he couldn't win in fair combat.[17][18] Orcs were not actually native toToril, but migrated from elsewhere to different parts of the world on several known occasions.[19][20][note 1] Orcs were known to the elves of Faerûn during theDawn Ages. At that time, they occasionally stole livestock from elven farms and attacked the elves themselves when encountered, but the elves had little trouble dealing with them. Rarely, they gathered into great hordes that swept across the lands.[21]Some time around−24,400 DR, anabassudemonof theAbysscalledHaeshkarrcommanded a horde of these orcs in the pillaging ofOccidian, an elven city. They then assaultedSharlarion, and the elves paid dearly to defeat them, with the heroineKethryllia Amarillisbattling Haeshkarr.[21][22][23] During the time of theFirst Flowering, well before−18,800 DR, orcs migrated throughportalsoriginally constructed by one of thecreator racesand arrived in northern Faerûn. But for more than fifteen millennia, they were not much more than feral savages who spent too much of their time fighting each other to catch the attention of the elven nations of the time, let alone trouble them.[19] Eventually, around−3800 DR, the northern orcs came together in proper tribes for the first time. Then, under two centuries later, mighty orc leaders unified their tribes into the first orc horde. In−3605 DR, this orc horde marched south and invadedNetheril, causing much devastation to the young nation until theNethereseand elven armies repelled them. Although they'd been defeated, the orcs discovered a love of warfare after that. Every few generations thereafter, when they'd grown populous enough again, they would gather in hordes to threaten the southern realms regularly.[19] Later, in the south, rebelwizardsofMulhorandandUntherled byThaydopened aportalinThayto the orc homeworld in−1081 DR. Some years later, in−1076 DR, an orc horde poured forth in their hundreds of thousands, triggering theOrcgate Wars, one of the biggest and most destructive conflicts involving orcs inFaerûn. They were not defeated until−1069 DR, and the remaining orcs dispersed around the land.[19][20] For millennia, orc hordes menaced the elven,human, anddwarvenrealms of Faerûn, topplingAmmarindar,Phalorm,Delzoun,Eaerlann, andIllefarnand at times devastating theSword Coastdown toCalimshan, as well asChessentaandthe Vast.[19] In theYear of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR, a confederacy of orc tribes united under the banner of King Obould Many-Arrows, achosenof Gruumsh. He forged a more civilized nation known as the Kingdom of Many-Arrows, located along the northern borders of Luruar.

This belief persisted despite the fact that their existence was one of wretched torment, the smallest movement causing their plating to grind against tissue and bone, resulting in horrible anguish. Only in combat were their minds sufficiently distracted to rise above their misery. So it was that orthons were creatures that lived for battle and had little interests beyond fighting and dying for their masters.[3] An orthon's first loyalty was to itsarchduke, but if given no assignment they sought out worthy opponents on their own. They valued the challenge of a chase and the thrill of one-on-one combat above all else,[5]and were joyful, almost to the point of childishness, in their love of violent play. They delighted in the spray of blood, relished the feeling of crushing bone, and flew into gleeful rage as the fight reached its deadly climax.[2]More than any other creature, they despiseddemonsand preferred them as victims.[3] Despite being somewhat simple-minded[3][2]and being in some respects known for sporting chances,[5]orthons were not to be mistaken as thoughtless brutes or easily gained. They were well-organized and unrelenting combatants who brooked their enemies no quarter,[3][2]and were fully capable of utilizing intelligent tactics.[3]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","The orthon Yurgir. Orthons were known to employ a diverse arsenal of infernal weaponry.[1][2][3]The most unique of these weapons were theirhellspears, masterfully-craftedcold ironlongspearswith a variety of sharp blades protruding along the shaft, thus making them usable against targets close up and afar. Such were their intense training and familiarity with these weapons that orthons could make sweeping strikes with the weapon to attack several targets at once.[3]Of similar utility were theirmauls, with which they could unleash a flurry of impacts upon all the foes around them, knocking them away and often to the ground.[2]They also possessed poisonousinfernal daggers.[1] The ranged weapon of the orthons, and the most versatile of them, were theirhellfire crossbows. From these brass and bone[1][3]instruments the orthons fired different types of arrows, including ones that spewed acid, released blinding light, unleashed concussive force, entangled opponents in strands of sticky webbing, and electrified and paralyzed their victim. The last kind let the orthon know theplanetheir target was on and their direction and distance from them once they were on the same plane, though this effect only lasted for a day.[1]The crossbows were dangerous even if the orthons ran out of arrows, or for that matter if they had no drawstring, for any baatezu could focus the crossbow and let loose a stream of purehellfire. This energy, so seemingly fire, was a unique force that ignored all resistance and immunity, and could only be spawned from the crossbow by baatezu hands; no other creature could focus the energy.[3] Orthons believed the best offense was a relentless rush of gnarly muscle and weapon blows;[2]this attitude was in some ways justified, such as by the fact that their invisibility was often best retaliated against with a strong counterattack.[1]This attitude aside, orthons still employed some degree of strategy. They were specially trained to kill demons, but were equally dangerous against mortals.[3] Orthons fought best when fighting in close formations where they could draw upon the skills and competence of their fellows. They were accustomed to fighting in military units and assembled themselves into two ranks. While the front rank brandished melee weapons, the backline scanned for and fired into the advancing enemy. If the enemy was outnumbered or seemed like it could be overwhelmed, the orthons would split into teams of two and flank them. However, while orthons were generally best used in squadrons of four to six (they themselves typically preferred four), this was not done outside of heavily contested warzones.[3] More often, orthons worked in pairs, where they practiced similar tactics to larger teams. A lone orthon was generally either cut off from his fellows or was assigned patrol duty and using their notorious special senses to keep watch for intruders. These orthons moved carefully and slowly, engaging enemies from as far as possible, generally by shooting them, before bracing for the charge, and spread out their attacks in hopes of taxing the enemy's resources. At the first sign of heavy resistance they retreated, preferably usinggreater teleport, and gathered more of their kind so they could return and finish off the foe.[3]","NOT FOUND","The masters of the Nine Hells, whether they bepit fiends, archdevils, or the archdukes themselves, had a number of uses for orthons.[1][3]Usually the task of locating and either eliminating or capturing a target was given to them, even if their quarry was on another plane of existence.[1]Fighting the Blood War was among their purposes,[2]and some infernal lords employed them as sentries and patrollers.[3] In the absence of an assignment, orthons might work for anyone promising dangerous enemy encounters. Their wide-reaching travels made them unrivaled guides through all the Nine Hells,[1]and they were likely to be found anywhere controlled or contested by devils, but they were common inAvernus, where they saw the most action.[3]They roamed that layer in packs, searching for opponents and allying with any infernal agent who guaranteed battle.[2] Since their abilities were nearly as dangerous to their fellow devils as they were to their demonic opposition, most of their kin treated orthons well.[3]Often they were paired withlegion devils, and the rage devils enjoyed watching them be slaughtered during the combat. Conversely, they admiredhell knightsand followed them into battle without question, even as the narzugons treated them like mindless chattel.[2] Orthons did usually carry treasure, but in the form of combat mementos, such as jeweled weapons,shields,belts, and other baubles.[3]","Orthons were possessed of a wide and reportedly varying set of powers.[1][2][3]By some tellings the powerful and robust devils were somewhat slow, but with that stable and difficult to move,[3]while in others they were fully mobile, capable of scaling obstacles with ease and incapable of becoming fatigued.[1]Other miscellaenous abilities included an immunity to beingcharmedand the spell-like ability toteleport without error. Orthons were known to create a variety of supernatural effects around themselves.[1][2][3]One was an invisibility field they could activate at will to cloak themselves and anything on their person, although it ended immediately after they attacked or were attacked.[1]Another was a 20 feet  (6.1 meters) radius dimensional interference field that disrupted all attempts at extradimensional travel within it similar to adimensional anchor; this only lasted a few dozen seconds, but there was no way to resist it and it could be activated at will.[2]The third effect was activated when the rage devil struck its foe in melee combat, causing the symbols of rage on its thick skin to flare and erode the resistances of their target.[3] In terms of consistent abilities, orthons were infamous for their sharp senses, sometimes reported as a form of close-rangetruesight[1]and at others as the ability tosee invisibilityat will. The other reliable power was some capacity for self-destruction, although even this took different forms. In the first, the voracious maggots infesting the orthon, which survived on its constantly seeping blood and pus, would surge out when it suffered a particularly scathing blow or burst from the body when it was slain, biting at all non-baatezu life in a desperate search for food for the brief period they could survive outside the host.[3]In the second, an orthon close to death could willingly choose to explode in a loud burst of flames; interestingly, an orthon's death in this way destroyed its special equipment,[1]but it also seemed to disintegrate when the orthon was slain even if not near the explosion.[9]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Orthons were the result of an experiment to create a new breed of devils to fight the Blood War, one capable of combating demons in the field of brute strength. To do this, demon ichor was injected into hell knights, which turned them into chaotic and uncontrollable creatures that were no longer truly devils. They craved carnage and raged against devils and demons alike, and only became true devils again when the ritualists bound their wild nature with glyphs in Supernal, the language of thegods.[2] During the period where the Blood War cooled around the 14thcentury, rage devils began to battle creatures not of theAbyss, even if they would still prefer to fight the demons.[2]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

"owlbear","Owlbears were monstrous beasts with the bodies of bears covered in thick shaggy coats of both bristly fur and feathers,[7][5][4][2]ranging in coloration from yellowish brown to a brownish black.[9][7][5]Fur was predominant on their bodies, while feathers became more common at their heads, and they had thick hides.[8]Their heads were avian, like those of owls, with large round eyes[5][2]with limpid pupils[2]and rimmed in red.[9][7][5]Their beaks were hooked[5]or serrated[2]and had a yellow to dull ivory hue.[9][7][5]Their claws were fleshy and, being avian, could be counted as talons.[4][12][13]Their terrible screeches were known to split the night and echo across the land as a warning to others.[4][2]Those who'd had run-ins with them and lived often described bestial insanity in its eyes. A little larger and heavier than females, a fully grown male specimen stood 8 feet  (2.4 meters) high and weighed 1,300​ to ​1,500 pounds (590​ to ​680 kilograms),[8][9][7][5]had 2‑inch (5.1‑centimeter) claws, and darker coats than females.[8][9][7] An owlbear (side view). Other traits were less obvious but still significant. An owlbear could rotate its forearms as ahumancould, granting it greater strength and agility than a regular bear, giving it a wider range of attack, and enabling it to 'hug' and grapple prey. Moreover, while it had forward-facing eyes like both bears and owls, it also could rotate its head up to 270°, owing to it having fourteen neckbones (humans had seven and could only turn through 180°), and it could whip its head around with shocking speed. They had a transparent third eyelid (known as a nictitating membrane) to guard against dust, dirt, and bright light. Unusually, an owlbear's ears were asymmetric, with one somewhat higher than the other, letting it exactly locate the origin of any sound. Finally, owlbears had the same long tongues as bears, so it could lap up liquids the same way.[14]They could be surrounded by a pungent stink.[15]","5eR5e4e3e2e1eVarious depictions of owlbears.Owlbear5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[2][1]SizeLargeSize (revised)OwlbearLargePrimeval owlbearHugeTypeMonstrosityAlignmentUnalignedChallenge rating3Challenge rating (revised)Owlbear3Primeval owlbear74th Edition Statistics[3][4]SizeLargeOriginFeyTypeBeastAlignmentUnaligned3rd Edition Statistics[5]SizeLargeTypeMagical beastAlignmentAlwaysneutralChallenge rating42nd Edition Statistics[6][7]SizeLargeAlignmentNeutral1st Edition Statistics[8][9]SizeLargeAlignmentNeutralGeneral InformationVisionScent,[5]low-light vision,[3]darkvision[4][2]Activity cycleNoon to midnight,[6]any,[5][3]nocturnal[4][2]DietCarnivore[6][7][5][3][4][2]Average lifespan20 years[7]Homeland(s)Feywild[3][4]IntelligenceLow,[9][7]Animal,[5][3][4]Semi-[2]SubracesSnowy owlbear[10]Favored climateTemperate[7][5]Favored terrainForests[7][5][4]Appearance[5]Average height8 ft  (2.4 m)[9][7][5]Average weight1,300‒1,500 lb (590‒680 kg)[9][7][5]Feather color(s)Brown-black to yellow-brown[9][5]DistinctionsBear-like bodyAvian headHooked beakHistoryFirst appearanceGreyhawkAnowlbearwas a largemagicalorfeybeastthat looked like a cross between anowland abear.

An owlbear fought with both its beak and its claws. They would try to slash and grab prey with one or both their claws, crush it in a bear-hug, and bite it and rend it in twain.[8][9][7][5][3][4][2][14]While in a bear-hug, an owlbear often could not use its claws, and so favored biting with its beak and using its brute strength to crush its victim.[14]In a fight, they simply targeted whatever was closest.[3] If wounded in a fight, they were known to screech so loudly it stunned nearby creatures, which the owlbear would then seize advantage of.[3][4]Even at the point of death, an owlbear would fight as vigorously as it would when healthy.[14] Owlbears were poor at climbing trees, owing to their large size and weight. But a victim who fled up a tree was not necessarily in the clear—the owlbear would simply wait under the tree or even knock it over if possible.[14]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","An owlbear naturally had a bear's keen sense of scent that it could use to track prey[5][2]as well as an owl's sharp eyesight for finding prey in the dark,[3][4][2]with specimens even reported to possesslow-light vision,[3]infravision,[14]ordarkvision.[4][2]They also had acute hearing able to locate a sound with pinpoint accuracy. As a result, it was nigh impossible to sneak past an owlbear, let alone sneak up on one, and they were not hampered by completedarknessor againstinvisiblefoes. Their nictitating membranes also protected their sensitive eyes from blinding lights.[14] Despite their unnatural origins, owlbears possessed no supernatural powers, though their calls were magical in nature. Different subspecies of owlbear had different calls, and these could have different magical effects.[4]","Little more intelligent than most animals,[9][7][2]with more cunning than an owl,[4]these creatures were incredibly aggressive and obstinate and were famous for their ferocity and foul temper. They would go so far as to attack almost anything that moved—anything larger than amouseand anything they thought they could kill—on sight and without any provocation.[8][9][7][5][3][4][2]They hunted so heavily because of their insatiable appetites, more than that of a giant owl and a bear combined.[9][7][4]A hungry owlbear feared nothing, not even superior strength and size or any other discouragement[4][2]or obstacle or impediment,[7]and with little instinct for self-preservation, they would fight to the death.[8][9][7][5][4]Only one that had already fed well was disinclined to attack a superior foe or risk its life.[16]However, an owlbear's ferocity was also its key weakness—they could be easily lured into a trap or tricked into charging off a cliff, if available.[7] Owlbears could be either diurnal or nocturnal, according to the habits of the local prey.[7][5][3]This arose from them being hybrids of the diurnal bear and the nocturnal owl.[7]Normally, owlbears would wake at midday, hunt daytime prey through afternoon and nocturnal prey through the evening, and go to sleep around midnight.[7]Nocturnal owlbears from around sunset to the darkest hours before sunrise.[4][2]Owlbears hibernated through the cold season and were most active in summer.[7] Owlbears communicated via hooting and screeching, at high volume and with a range of pitches and durations.[7][17]They hooted or screeched to signal their territory and to drive prey into their hunting grounds. Owlbears also screeched as a way to attract a mate.[4][2] An owlbear's eating habits are not particularly pleasant. Owlbears were entirely carnivorous.[6][7][5][3][4][2][14]They typically preyed on animals likerabbits,bears,snakesand otherreptiles, but also preyed ontrolls.[7]Someclaimed owlbears especially enjoyed the taste ofelves.[15]When an owlbear successfully caught its prey, it tended to consume part of it on the spot, before dragging the rest back to its lair to be stored, with parts of the carcass stashed amongst or hanging on rocks, bushes, and trees.[7][4][2]An owlbear would also scavenge a carcass.[18]Owlbears tore their prey into chunks and swallowed these whole as owls did. Moreover, in the stomach, the flesh was digested, while bones, fur, feathers, and insect shells were churned into pellets and regurgitated; these tended to indicate an owlbear lair was close by.[14]The scent of flesh that emanated from an owlbear's lair often attracted scavengers and, therefore, more prey, though it acted as a warning to other creatures.[4][2]The sole exception to their carnivorous diet was a liking forhoney, which they inherited from regular bears. They could lap it up with their thick tongues and their thick coats protected them from angrybees. A jar of honey was effective bait for owlbear hunters.[14]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","How the owlbear came to be was a long-running argument among scholars. The mostly widely held theory was of course that the first owlbear was the product of a demented mage crossing a bear and agiant owl.[9][7][5][2]The goal was likely to combine the bear's strength, stamina, and claws and the owl's keen senses, but the experiment was likely a failure, given how bad-tempered and untrainable it would've been.[124]In any case, the mage was most likely killed by it too.[7]Some accounts rejected this notion, but still could not explain them.[4]The oldestelvesrecalled that owlbears had been around for many millennia and a fewfeyclaimed owlbears had always been found in theFeywild.[2]If this was correct, owlbears had originated as Feywild predators before somehow finding their way into the material world in ancient times.[3]In the wake of theTime of Troubles, a new theory was put forward that such creatures as owlbears andperytonswere abominations created in pastgodswarsthat survived and bred true.[125]In fact, onToril, at least, owlbears were brought into being by one of thecreator races,[126]most likely theaearee.[speculation][note 1] The enemy.

The shadow did not usually resemble the shape of the beast; instead, it was said to appear as the outline of whatever creature whose heart the peryton last ate,[3]usually an adult human.[4]Other reports suggested that the peryton's shadow wasalwaysthat of a human, and a legend told that they had once been humans themselves, hence the human shadow.[10]There was some controversy as to when and what shadow would be cast by a peryton. Some argued that the only time a peryton cast its own shadow was immediately after killing a victim but before consuming it.[7]Others said that a peryton's shadow reverted to its own onlyaftereating a heart and for a brief period afterwards.[4]Some attributed this phenomenon specifically to the female.

If drawn into melee combat, they hopped about on the ground, using their wings to stay about 5 feet (1.5 meters) off the ground.[3][8]Stronger perytons would sometimes carry smaller prey and drop them from great heights.[4]Whichever target was chosen, a peryton rarely changed to a new one until either the target or peryton were killed.[4] Whenever an opponent was helpless or unconscious—whether from crippling, paralysis,etc.—a peryton would attempt to rip the heart from the victim with its claws.

No one knew for sure how they'd come to be, but there many theories had been put forward.[10]Many scholars pointed to the facts that a peryton had the scent and shadow of a human and required a human heart to reproduce, and concluded that they had once been human, perhaps cursed or magically transformed millennia before.[8]Perytons were generally said to be the creation of one of the evil deities, but which one is forgotten.[7]It was known that theBeast Lordof the ruins ofDekanterpropagated perytons, but whether he first created them or only bred them was not clear.[22] An alternative and perhaps more sinister tale was put to paper by BrotherDelfofVerdusk, apparently relating an ancient legend. He told that perytons had once been theKhalaofImaskar, a human race of evilBane-worshipers. As punishment for their crimes, they were cursed by five gods of law.Lathander, god of the dawn, said ""You have been swift as an eagle in your flight from justice, so I curse you each of you with the body of the eagle.""Mystra, goddess of magic, said ""Fierce as a wolf have you been in your persecution of the innocent, so I curse you with the teeth of the wolf.""Torm, god of duty, said ""Foolish as a stag in rut have you been as you shunned what is true and good, so I curse you all to bear the head and horns of the stag.""Ilmater, god of suffering, said ""You have tormented and torn heart and soul from your victims, so I curse you with unnatural appetites, so that you may only live and prosper after devouring the hearts of your prey."" Finally,Mielikki, goddess of the forest, said ""While you acted as beasts, your heart contained evil which only humans can know. I curse you to always cast the shadow of the humans you once were, to always remind you of your terrible deeds and of the souls that you have lost."" Thus, they became the perytons. This tale was unsupported by fact, but it did explain all their unusual human traits. However, some, likeTalyssa Strongbow, considered it ironic that their curses, particularly that of Ilmater—who aimed to shield folk from suffering—only drove the peryton to further murder and savagery. This cast doubt on the tale, or on the wisdom of the gods.[10] In theYear of the Groaning Cart, 1267 DR, perytons, along withharpiesandmanticores, destroyed the city ofLisin theMoonsearegion in what was known as theFlying Plague.[23] Sometime around1372 DR, KingObould Many-Arrowsmade an arrangement with the perytons living in theSpine of the Worldto defend his eastern border.

Quasits could rival the averagehumanin brainpower, and normally possessed a deep cunning able to compensate for their lack of intellect. The small fiends excelled at deception, the words they spoke and their actual meaning rarely being the same thing.[5][10] Quasits were insidious creatures with a ceaseless craving for power in all its forms.[10]Despite this personal desire for power and success however, they were physically weak and mostly cowardly beings that shied away from direct confrontation.[1][3]Unlike most other members of their kind,[11]quasits had a healthy sense of self-preservation, and when cornered would do almost anything to survive.[10]Although they preferred to act alone, they normally familiarized themselves with the locations of other demons in case they found themselves in danger.[2][12]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Despite their physical frailty, quasits could be fearsomely annoying and maddening to fight, able to wreak havoc and create unending distractions for their adversaries. Thankfully, unless they had some sort of advantage, most relied on their invisibility to flee battles rather than sticking around to battle.[10]When quasits did fight, they preferred to strike in ambushes rather than in normal fights, their various abilities making them capable assassins. Their most effective leading tactic was to turn into an innocuous animal, (although turning invisible would also work) to avoid detection as they approached their target, astruesightwould be needed to discern a morphed quasit's real form.[10][3] A battle against a quasit was one of attrition as it used blinding speed to strike at its enemies before slinking away, allowing its poison to slowly debilitate their foe.[3]Those with wings swooped down to deliver their poison before retreating to the trees for cover. Since their poison reduced mobility and dexterity, their normal targeting order went from obvious spellcasters first, to those with ranged weapons, to general combatants likefightersandrogues, often trying to make the chosen target completely helpless first before attacking or fleeing. As such, means ofdelayingorneutralizingpoisons were vital.[10] If the need for retreat arose, quasits would strike fear into their enemies before running away, an indication that something had gone horribly wrong since they reserved this ability otherwise.[10][3]Quasits were likely to change form in these instances if doing so would make it easier for them to escape. Trying to ambush one was difficult unless one was both non-good and lacked magical equipment, or had a way of disguising these things. Given their cowardice, a cornered quasit convinced that they were trapped, would be more than willing to trade information for their life, the particularly desperate even offering the use ofcommune, preventing them from lying.[10] Their mode of behavior was slightly different however when around other demons or serving a master. Quasits would rather manipulate more powerful beings to fight for them than even make their presence known to others. Often they whispered temptations of power when adversaries made themselves apparent, coaxing their masters into doing their bidding.[2]In these situations, a quasit acted as support, distracting enemies and sneaking up on them when unexpected.[10]Such tactics often didn't work on larger demons, and quasits would much prefer to just let them fight without interfering.[2]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Quasits shared the imp powers ofinvisibilityand resistance to both non-magical weaponry and pure magic.[1]A minor regenerative power also made quasits somewhat hard to kill over an extended period of time, and if killed they would reform in the Abyss in a year and a day.[4]Both were capable ofdetecting goodandmagicat will.[3] The abilities of a quasit that distinguished them from those of imps were few but vital. Unlike imps, their talons were coated in an irritating toxin that caused those they struck to be consumed with a burning itch, as opposed to a more directly deadly poison delivered through a stinger. Quasits also lacked the wings of imps, but could scamper on land faster than them. However, these differences were not universal, as some quasits were noted to have both stingers and wings.[1][3][4][10] Quasits, like imps, could also polymorph into one or two other choice forms, but in the case of a quasit they were normallybats,toads,centipedes, orwolves. Most notable of these differences was that while imps could use supernaturalsuggestiononce a day, quasits instead could send a wave ofterrorat those nearby.[1][3][4] Quasits also had the ability to contact the forces of theLower Planes, normally ademon lord, forcommunionevery week to aid in their decision-making process.[5]Quasits in service to a master on theMaterial Planebestowed several benefits. The two maintained a telepathic bond, breakable by the quasit at any time, allowing them to use the other's senses so long as they were within a mile of each other.

They combined the habits of a predatory aristocrat with those of an indolent cat, savoring the finest art, music, literature, clothing, weapons and armor while spending large amounts of time lazily resting in their comforts and prowling unseen. Powerful magic, lost spells, arcane tomes and secret lore, particularly those of the evil variety, were of special interest to the born sorcerers. Slaves were collected the same as any other form of art, and were expected to indulge every whim of their cruel master.[7]This served to bolster the already overinflated ego of the rakshasa, a haughtiness they displayed to all who knew their true identity.[5][7] Rakshasas used their transformative abilities to appear as nobles, cardinals, merchant princes, crime lords and other beings rich in power.[1][2]They used their natural charisma to form vast arrays of minions, lackeys, servitors and henchmen, and despite their pride were masters of deceit. Rakshasas disguised not only their forms, but their very involvement in events, pulling political strings, creating vast intrigues, and instigating government corruption to secure their safety.[7]Their innate cleverness was enhanced by their supernatural abilities, and yet countered by their strange sense of honor, as like devils they would hold to the letter of an agreement while ignoring the spirit to double-cross their supposed allies.[5][7] Rather than steal from other powerful beings, rakshasas favored robbing the poor and needy, using their assumed authority to obtain riches and items from those that needed them most.[7]Their ability to gain dominion and rise to power while causing others to fall was a source of pride and joy for them.[1][7]They would plot the death of a mortal's family, take everything they had, and ruin their reputation through vicious slander, but nothing brought them more pleasure in this activity than turning a model citizen's society against them by exposing hidden truths.[7]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","A rakshasa warrior. In the repertoire of a rakshasa, their most powerful weapon was their mastery of misdirection as they used their expertise in deceit they entangle their enemies in webs of mistruths. Their illusory powers and vast array of potential identities made even recognizing their existence a struggle and even then it took skill and careful planning to defeat them. Powerfuldivinationmagic was required simply to dispel their supernatural deceptions but they nonetheless had many ways to win without fighting.[7] Rakshasas had entire networks of corrupt officials and powerful bodyguards at their disposal, and only allowed their most loyal and trustworthy minions near them. Only a small number of their closest aides knew of their true form and so enchantment magic was often needed in order to prompt a betrayal by such servitors.[7] Rakshasas fought as cravens when behind their numerous protections, using magic to enhance their speed or defenses, attempting to use their enchantment magic to dissuade combat and targeting spellcasters due to their typical inability to harm them.[7]Often times they would attempt to masquerade as an ally of their prey, waiting for the right moment to strike them down.[5] Unless protected by a spell such asmind blankornondetectionthey would instantly sense the location of thinking creatures, but would need to focus their efforts on a specific area for a few seconds in order to decipher a potential adversary's surface thoughts, forcing them to stay nearby while attempting to discern intentions. When under attack, rakshasas rarely used their mind reading in the open, instead using hit and run tactics to maneuver to an area of safety and read the enemies' plans, allowing strategies to be changed when needed.[7]Offensive magic was normally saved as a last resort and most disdained physical fighting as ignoble.[7][3] In contrast to their typically elusive nature, rakshasas when cornered fought valiantly and fiercely, proving themselves to be dangerous melee combatants in addition to being powerful spellcasters.[3][5]Their reversed hands gave them no trouble in terms of dexterity, allowing them to wield weapons with dangerous effectiveness, a necessary skill as their shapechanging prevented them from using their teeth and claws. Rakshasas trained as warriors pounced like tigers with their blades while archers were just as deadly. However, most rakshasas took every measure needed to prevent physical altercations and, if the opportunity presented itself, would immediately abandon melee in order to continue casting from afar, attempting to blind and confuse current assailants to escape.[2][3]","NOT FOUND","A typical lair of a rakshasa. Rakshasa communities on theOuter Planeswere protected by greater rakshasas or ruhks, a term meaning knight, skilled warriors of great speed and martial prowess.[2][5]15% of rakshasas were ruhks and 15% of the ruhks were rajahs, a term meaning lord, that led their clans. 5% of rajahs were maharajahs, a term meaning duke, that led several small interrelated clans or singular massive clans. Their island societies were composed of hundreds of members with the duke as the unquestionable leader, although dukes were known to serve under even more dangerous entities and clans would be run by a rajah in the absence of a maharajah.[5]The rakshasas ofAcheronwere infamous beings that laired on hidden cubes veiled from prying eyes by powerful illusion magic. Each clan kidnappedpetitionersandplanewalkersto serve as slaves in their palaces in an attempt to impress the maharajah that ruled over every rakshasa on theplane.[11] Befitting beings of deception, early reports on rakshasa society contradicted later descriptions, although both were based on subservience and subjugation and it was possible some combination of the two was present. Earlier claims were that rakshasas belonged to a unshakable caste system and that individuals were incapable of rising through the ranks.[5]Later descriptions portrayed it as a meritocracy based on guile and ruthless immorality, where rakshasas constantly waged conspiratorial wars against each other. Enslavement, rakshasa or not, was an indication of power and their political battles ended either in the death or domination of the loser. As rakshasas grew in reputation and prestige they would gain the noble titles of ruhk and rajah, reaching maharajah status after the successful conquest of all others rakshasas in the region.[7] Female rakshasas, rakshasi, raised children independent of males, teaching their children vital lessons about their society. Rakshasi were unyielding disciplinarians, but the rigorous and ruthless tests they employed were contrasted by their pampering praise. The reason for this was likely the patriarchal nature of rakshasa society, as females were meant only to be faithful, childbearing spouses that raised powerful offspring. The rakshasi population was somewhere between having just as large a population as males and having three times their numbers, and males could very well have harems.[5][7]The nature of power was important in a rakshasa's education, as they learned that those in power could just as easily retract their gifts as they could bestow them. Mature rakshasas wasted no time establishing their criminal empires and may have already done so.[7]","Rakshasas were naturally adept sorcerers, able to use a wide variety ofenchantmentandillusionspells to beguile their enemies anddetect the thoughtsof others at will.[1][3]Most magic was of no use against rakshasas, as only some of the most powerful spells were able to affect them unless they allowed it.[3][5]Only potent, enchanted weapons were capable of properly harming them, but piercing weapons that had beenblessed, or potentially those wielded by good creatures, were particularly effective. Blessed crossbow bolts and arrows were said to instantly kill them, but it was said they had to be pierced through the heart with such weapons to truly slay them.[1][2][5] Rakshasas could shapeshift as long as they desired and their new forms could not be magically dispelled, althoughtruesightcould pierce their guise and they reverted to normal upon death.[3]Their claws contained a magical curse that plagued the minds of those struck with nightmares and terrifying figments, preventing them from resting properly unless the curse wasremoved.[1]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Despite there being innumerable documented cases of rakshasas influencing worldly politics the known examples were but a fraction of the extent of their duplicitous exploits. Scholars that investigated their sinister schemes found that they could be connected to the downfall of several organizations, merchant houses, and churches, the instigators of unspeakable tragedies and the collapse of entire governments. The elimination of investigative scholars was one of the few occasions during which rakshasas would unite. The exact origins of the rakshasas were shrouded in mystery and legend, not helped by the proud and insidious rakshasas themselves that, if they knew their history, would never willingly share it and likely went out of their way to make it confusing and contradictory.[7] Rumors that claimedarcanalothswere originallydemonsthat were banished from the Abyss for their deceptiveness also stated that they were the ancestors of the rakshasas andraavastas. Rakshasas strongly disputed such stories despite their demon-like cruelty, greed, and conniving nature, dismissing them as slurs against their honorable race and an accusation of degeneracy.[2][19]More recently, it was claimed that the rakshasas were the result of an infernal ritual from Hell, made from an enigmatic but nonetheless powerful race of devils in a bid to escape Baator. Indeed, rakshasas had various hallmarks of devilish descendance and more popular ideas were that they were caused by a union of ancientfiendishanimals and devils.[1][7] Still, it was entirely possible that rakshasas were an entirely distinct race of fiends as their specific brand of malevolence was utterly unique.[7]Many, less specific legends merely stated they came from ""a distant land"" like a poverty-inducing plague to corrupt and drain every society they came across[7]and some said that the horror-inflicting fiends were the manifestation of nightmares.[1][5]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

However, their instinct to survive and need to soak their hats in fresh blood was the root of their murderous nature.[1] Favoring attacking head on, they had no sense of subtlety. Even when they tried to be stealthy, their heavy iron boots made them noisy and menacing, and clumsy except when rushing to the slaughter.[1]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Asun elffends off a group of red caps. Redcaps typically wieldedscythes,sickles,[2][1]slings,[2]or other heavy bladed weapons that seemed much too big for them.[2][1]They favored attacking from ambush, usually as their prey were about to settle down for an evening. They began with their slings but swiftly closed to melee where they could swing their blades, hard and recklessly, before their victim could get their defenses up. They were brutal and merciless in battle.[2] Elder redcaps used the same tactics, but would also track wounded or weakened prey for miles, just waiting for them to relax their guard.[2] Redcaps could theoretically live as long as 150 years, but most died much younger, given their deadly lives.[2]","NOT FOUND","An example of a madcap. Redcaps were natural loners, and rarely banded together.[2][1]When they did, they did so only in odd numbers, forming small gangs of 3 or 5 or bands of 7, 9, or 11. Redcaps usually lurked within caves and old keeps and towers, usually abandoned after some tragedy or after they'd massacred any former inhabitants.[2] With hot tempers, redcaps argued and brawled with one another incessantly, usually to the death. They would slaughter each other without hesitation. It required an elder redcap, even more than one, to reign in their tempers and murderous impulses, mostly by bullying the youngers into submission.[2] Occasionally, a  redcap would soak its cap indemon ichorinstead of blood. This caused them to become an even more violent and volatile variant known as amadcap, who were known to incinerate upon their deaths.[3]","Redcaps needed to kill constantly in order to continue existing, absorbing a little of the essence of everything they slew. Their pointed red hats needed to remain soaked in fresh blood,[2][1]which had to be replenished at least once every three days, otherwise the redcap would simply disappear, a fact they were entirely aware of.[1]The more they did this, the more their physical abilities enhanced and the more resilient and naturally armored they became. It took acold ironweapon to overcome their unnatural durability. An elder redcap, one that achieved great age and many kills possessed terrible strength and agility and was practically invulnerable.[2] Despite their small bodies and scrawny frames, they were actually fairly strong and relatively powerful, as capable as human-sized beings at swinging a large weapon or wrestling with a foe. They were fast for their small size.[2][1] Their heavy iron boots made them noisy, but not slow. They could kick a foe to much injury and knock them down.[1] When a redcap hurled a bullet from asling, it glowed greenish-blue with an eldritch energy, and it struck harder than normal.[2] When it died, a redcap vanished completely, leaving behind just one tooth, which had magical power.

The first was after a great victory by the gnoll war band. After the slaughter, a shoosuva would appear in a cloud of billowing, odorous smoke before an exalted individual, normally the strongest fang of Yeenoghu present, and bond to them. A shoosuva responded foremost to the commands of their respective shamans, over the orders of otherwitch doctorsand even leaders. As such, those with shoosuva companions were second only to aflindleader in the loose war band hierarchy.[1] The second method was to attempt to summon a shoosuva directly. After reaching a sufficient level of physical fortitude and clerical power, a shaman would be mentally given instructions on how to call a shoosuva. This was done via a talisman made from the bones of another gnoll shaman or witch doctor that was carved into the shape of a hyena skull and thrown to the ground. Once this was done, the caster would utter Yeenoghu's name, causing the Prince of Gnolls togatein a shoosuva to the summoner's location within a few seconds. Shoosuvas called this way remained until one hour elapsed or they were slain, both of which caused their spirits to return to the Abyss. Shoosuva called this way asked for rotten meat as a reward for service, assuming they were not killed, and failing to provide any resulted in a refusal to respond to further summoning by all shoosuva.[3] Finally, a shoosuva could be called to theMaterial Planeby any shaman or witch doctor of Yeenoghu in a request for assistance or advice. This method still required carrion and was far inferior to the secondary method. Even the most powerful of Yeenoghu's faithful had less than a 50% chance to succeed and the shoosuva summoned only remained for a few minutes if not seconds. If attacked or if their summoner was attacked in the short time while they were being questioned, a shoosuva would waste no time mauling the offender with whatever limited time it had.[3]Shoosuva were foremost loyal to Yeenoghu and their advice and assistance extended only as far as what Yeenoghu allowed them to give.[1][3]","The hallmark ability of a shoosuva was their ability to inflict paralysis through the stingers on their tails,[1]although it was once thought to be a byproduct of their bite.[3]Those paralyzed would become incapable of movement beyond basic life functions, making them easy pickings for the shoosuva and nearby gnolls.[1][3]Befitting their guardian role, shoosuva could not be magically manipulated using charm- or fear-based magics and several other mental powers.[3]Like most demons, electricity, fire, poison, and ice magic were of limited use against them, as well as non-magical weaponry.[1]Despite not being properundead, they were still somewhat necromantic, although reports on the effect of turning and controlling them using clerical powers were nebulous. Another rumored ability within the shoosuva's arsenal was the power to command gnolls to do their bidding against their will and even at the cost of their own lives.[3]This control was purported to extend to the end of their telepathic reach.[1][3]","Shoosuva were intensely loyal to a particular gnoll cultist above all other gnolls.[1]Their favorite food was rancid meat and personally enlisting one often entailed bribing it with carrion.[3]Contrary to what their animalistic appearance suggested, shoosuva were fairly intelligent, especially by gnoll standards.[1]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Yeenoghu often involved himself in the lives of his followers through portents and signs, but he did not shy away from more direct methods of involvement when possible.

Such lairs were guarded by armies of lesser demons and charmed monsters, allowing a sibriex to focus on strengthening their position.[3]","Sibriexes warped not only the physical reality around them but twisted the minds of those nearby.[1]Those that dared to approach them were not onlypoisonedby their toxic aura of corruption, but they risked their minds being tainted by a sibriex's eldritch influence and might start viewing it as the perfect life form. Such a mind-warping power drained the victim's personality and self-esteem, although other demons and those with sibriex-grafted flesh were immune.

If for whatever reason a being wanted to accept a sibriex's flesh-warping, they could undergo an excruciating, hour-long process that permanently transformed them without turning them into a wretch. Some also claimed they could graft flesh instantly, if a limited amount of times each day, using Abyssal chaos as the material. Results of accepting the flesh-warping included the expansion, reduction, multiplication, transition, creation, animation and otherwise alteration of one's anatomy.[1][3] Sibriexes could freely manipulate the four chains attached to their bodies using their telekinesis. The chains were not truly parts of them, acting more as weapons or items that could be broken despite being highly durable. Sibriexes could use their creation-based abilities to make new chains if their old ones broke.[3] From the feeding tubes that hung off their lower bodies, sibriexes could spit shots of highly acidic, black bile at their enemies in order to liquefy them.

Their preferred food was freshdemihumanmeat, especiallyelves. Due to the natural resistance elves had to the harpy's song, harpies viewed their meat as an especially rare delicacy.[7] Harpies made homes in groups of six or more individuals within marshlands or in caves near shorelines, which were preferably near well-traveled routes.[6]They were often encountered alone, in pairs, or in packs of seven to a dozen harpies known as ""flights"".[3]However, a tribe of harpies, known as a ""scream"", could be as large as two hundred.[7]There was no social structure to harpy life. There was constant quarreling, which sometimes resulted in fights to the death. When deaths did occur, harpies were willing to eat their own kind. Otherwise, harpies ventured out to hunt, and their victims were often brought back to the lair to be killed and eaten.[6] Harpies were generally uninterested in treasure or wealth, but they would always take at least one possession from a victim back to their lair as a symbol of their kill.[7] A few successful harpies took up the bow as archers, mastering this tactic and going at it alone as cruel hunters, bandits, and mercenaries, usually operating as bandits when not hired as mercenaries. Such harpies acquired much wealth in the form of the tools of their trade.[3] It was not unknown for harpies to cooperate with other evil humanoids if it served their interests.[6]","The deadliest power of the harpy was its insidious and captivating song.

When not guarding something, if they were attacked by any opponent powerful enough to harm them, they would typically flee. Spectators only willingly fought against those who disturbed what they were guarding, those who persistently pestered them,[8]and other spectators.[2]The methods used to repel foes would become more drastic as the battle continued, starting with fear and confusion and escalating into paralysis and enervation.[8] Though they could planeshift, they would only do so to retreat if injured in all eyes to the point of non-functionality, thus leaving them incapable of guarding their wards. If chased after this point, they would defend themselves by biting at their pursuer.[7]They would return one day after leaving, and in any circumstance, their ward's disappearance would prompt them to return to Nirvana for good.[8]","NOT FOUND","Spectators hailed from Mechanus and could be summoned to the Material Plane by a ritual requiring at least 4 beholder eyes. Using more eyes would increase the chance of the ritual's success, with 10 ensuring completion. The beholder eyes would be ground into a powder, burnt until the powder was nothing but black dust, then doused with oil, set on fire and placed in a special magic circle. Using the dust as the component a wizard would create a one way gate to Nirvana and call the monster in a way similar to thesummon monsterspell.[6][7]Once summoned this way, spectators would be placed in their contemplative condition, and peacefully reside for 101 years in an approximate 100 yard area from where they were summoned to.[8]No one but the summoner and beings stated to be allowed during the initial dealing would be permitted to touch or enter the area it was summoned to guard.[2] Spectators were organized into an upper and lower class. The lower class resided alone in small vertical caves in themodrondisk dug out using their mouths. The upper class worked as guards for important modron and were educated to uphold the lawful ideals of Mechanus. Lower class spectators tended to drift between lawful good and lawful neutral, while upper class were strictly lawful neutral. The only way to become an upper class spectator was to capture and deliver a rogue modron to local Mechanus authorities. The position was not permanent and would be revoked in a spectator's old age when they could no longer fight, forcing them to retire to their caves. High leveled modrons, and even spectators themselves would bargain with the bodies of slain spectators to be used for research by others.[7]","A happy spectator. Their main eye could turn spells back at the caster so long as they were in the nearby area and shooting at its face. The four eyestalks of a spectator could cause effects like thespellsparalyze,inflict moderate wounds,fear, andconfusion.[2]They were capable of creating enough food and water to sustain themselves for one day, every day, meaning that they would never go hungry, and could alsoplane shiftonce per day. When trapped within the bounds of a ritual circle created with beholder eyes, a spectator was powerless to use any ability besides levitation.[7]","Spectators were vigilant and trustworthy, and could be relied upon to protect items in all but the most dire situations. They possessed two methods of behavior: a free-thinking mode and a contemplative mode. Free-thinking spectators would wander the planes at will, openly, if cautiously, chatting with those they came across. In their contemplative state, they were philosophers who would spend over a century pondering vast philosophical questions. Approached in this state they were still friendly and enjoyed discourse but would soon after request to be left alone so as to continue philosophizing.[8]Years of isolation could result in spectators gaining personality quirks such as referring to themselves in the third person or adopting the voice of its summoner.[2] Spectators disliked guarding things for lesser lifeforms, which most mortal summoners would qualify as, and would only do so hesitantly. After promising to do so, however, their loyalty to their summoner was absolute, guarding the object in question until their time was up. They prided themselves on their guardianship and refused commands to do anything else until asked to guard something else or they were allowed to leave a summoner's grasp. The greatest pleasure for most spectators was thwarting the forces of chaos and in defending valuable objects. A spectator's strong sense of justice dictated that creatures who did not intrude upon their duties had a right to live, and they would never attack a helpless opponent unless attacked via sly or cruel means. Killing creatures for any reason outside of duty or self-defense would lead most spectators to commit suicide in distress via self-imposed brain overload.[7] Somewhat mild and even-tempered, they were even known to form friendships with other creatures, a trait that no other beholderkin or truebeholderever displayed.[4]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","In1370 DR,Waterdeepwas briefly plagued by a small army of spectators who were sent there to ""guard"" powerful and notable enchanted items, such asKhelben Arunsun'sBlackstaffandPiergeiron Paladinson'sHalcyon.

"thri-kreen","A thri-kreen resembled a giant praying mantis, bipedal and standing 4.5–7 feet (1.4–2.1 meters) high and weighing 100–375 pounds (45–170 kilograms); a full-grown adult averaged at 6 feet (1.8 meters) and 200 pounds (90 kilograms). They had exoskeletons over their entire bodies.[4][5]They had six limbs protruding from their thorax: two for walking and four for use as arms, ending in four-fingered claw-like hands capable of tool- and weapon-use. Their insectoid heads had two black, multi-faceted compound eyes; two small antennae sprouting from the top; and a complex jaw structure with large sharp mandibles.[6][4][5][9]It was extremely difficult to distinguish the males and females.[6] The carapace of a thri-kreen was typically a sandy yellow in hue, but could vary from a sandy brown to a pale green color, as best suited the environment. This enabled thri-kreen to blend in with the dry savannas and grasslands they dwelled in.[6][4][5][9] Thri-kreen wore little to no clothing or armor. Instead, they wore only simpleleatherbelts, harnesses, or slings to hold their food, equipment, and weaponry, and only as much as they needed.

The thri-kreen were a race of nomads and hunters. They were also known asmantis warriorsand sometimes called""tri-kreen"".[6][4][9][5][10]","Thri-kreen had no clear or definable personalities as humans would know them. No emotions could be discerned from their insectoid faces or their patterns of behavior, though rapid twitching of their antennae or mandibles indicated agitation.[4]Acting spontaneously, they were unpredictable and always ofchaoticalignment, showing no inclination towardgoodorevil. These traits made them utterly alien and inscrutable to other races, and folk unfamiliar with them regarded them as savage and brutal monsters.[4][5] In fact, thri-kreen simply viewed themselves and other beings in terms of the relationship between predator and prey. They saw themselves as noble hunters,[5]and were wholly focused on survival and the basic needs of existence, a life in which the weak died and the strong survived. They were not cruel or evil if they had no need to be, but nor did they go out of their way to aid others if they did not have to.[4]By instinct, they saw humanoid beings as food first and as trading partners or allies second.[6] Their alien thought patterns made it hard for them to understand the advanced concepts or sophisticated social rules of other races.[4][5]They lacked ideas of devotion, honor, or loyalty, but they respected skill and strength and recognized the convenience of working with talented hunting companions. They maintained no traditions, and saw no benefit in the traditions of others.[4]They valued little that humanoids made.[6]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","A thri-kreen wielding a gythka and hurling a chatkcha. When hunting prey, thri-kreen used their natural and unnatural camouflage abilities to get close and observe. They always spared the time to prepare, using their psionic powers to boost their defensive and offensive capability. They then quickly closed the distance with their speed and jumping prowess, but if the fight went against them, they retreated just as quickly, using their camouflage to hide once more.[4][5] In melee, the mantis warriors were whirlwinds of violence, preferring their four claws and venomous bites, but also wielding strange weapons. The thri-kreen primarily fought with two types of weapons unique to their kind: thegythka, a double-ended, crescent-headed polearm; and thechatkcha, a crystalline throwing wedge. With four arms, a thri-kreen could wield two gythkas or throw up to four chatkchas at a time. As exotic as these weapons were, they came naturally to trained mantis warriors.[6][4][5]","NOT FOUND","Thri-kreen mated in the spring. The females dug egg chambers and laid clutches of up to 120 eggs, before reburying and abandoning it. The eggs hatched in mid-summer; the larvae looked like miniature adult thri-kreen. They survived on instinct alone, discovering hunting and tool-making skills and how to survive, but 90% of larvae perished[6]before reaching adulthood after only 5 or 6 summers[6][4][5]Thri-kreen were short-lived; if they survived their harsh lives, they could be considered middle-aged at 12 or 16, old by 18 to 20, and truly venerable at 25. No thri-kreen lived past 35 by natural means.[4][5] Thri-kreen were distinctly not social in nature.[6]Each thri-kreen developed deep personal attachments to only a small handful of other thri-kreen, their clutch-mates. They would defend these companions at all costs, even at the cost of their own lives. All creatures outside this small band were viewed as strangers and enemies, though a wandering thri-kreen didn't advertise such beliefs for the sake of peace.[5]They formed small and independent packs, almost always of their clutch-mates,[6][4]but sometimes lone young thri-kreen or survivors of failed packs would join existing packs or find each other and establish new packs.[6]Rarely, a few packs would ally to combine their strength when they faced a more dangerous threat.[4] They had very nomadic lifestyles, with packs journeying great distances within their extensive territories over their relatively short lifespans. Permanent settlements of thri-kreen were completely unheard of.[4][5] Thri-kreen packs spent their days foraging and hunting for the food and other supplies they need to survive.[4]They could survive on relatively little food and water, and were carnivorous, pursuing a variety of creatures as prey.[6]Thri-kreen tribes like the Krakk't typically huntedrabbits,horses(which they considered a delicacy), and other herd beasts.[10][19]They also especially enjoyed the taste ofelves.[6][19][6]Leftover meat they dried and saved to eat later, but when times were tough, they would eat carrion or even cannibalize each other, even their young.[6] Sometimes—usually requested by a thri-kreen leader, but not always—a thri-kreen left their pack to explore lands outside their territory, on the basis that the information gained would be useful for the pack's survival. Such lone thri-kreen often fell in with others who wandered the land, simply in order to survive. In the process, they learned their ways and bonded with them, adopting them as new clutch-mates. Most became caravan guards across the plains, but rarely a wandering thri-kreen joined with an adventuring party.[4][5]","Thri-kreen had superior physical abilities compared to ahuman, with high strength and great agility. They were faster on their feet, and naturally and supremely good at jumping. They were quick enough to deflect or dodge an incoming projectile. Their carapace was naturally armored, being tough and resistant to impact, and its sandy color helped them hide in sandy or barren landscapes. Thri-kreen typically grew to be skilled in their senses, hiding, jumping, climbing, and balancing.[6][4][5] A thri-kreen's four claws and a bite from its mandibles were dangerous natural weapons. They secreted a paralyzingpoisonfrom their mouths, sufficient for a single venomous bite per day. This could hamper a victim's agility, or cause paralysis for several minutes.[6][4][5] Thri-kreen were naturallypsionicbeings, possessing psionic energy and knowing innately a number of powers. A thri-kreen could manifest the powerschameleonandknow direction and locationthrice each per day, andgreater concealing amorphaandmetaphysical clawonce each per day.[4][5] They could see in the dark throughdarkvision, and did not sleep at all, making them immune tosleepspells and the like.[4][5]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","A trio of spelljamming thri-kreen adventurers.

The tenets and philosophy of this major sect of thri-kreen religion at that time were largely incomprehensible and alien to other races, yet the People of the Celestial Mantis had a strong belief in the need to spread their religion among the crystal spheres. When other races did not convert to the faith of the spacefaring thri-kreen, they used theirspelljammingnavies to force the infidels to convert.[8] From715 DR, the three cities of theShining Plains—Assam,Lheshayl, andOrmath—spent the next three centuries in skirmishes and minor battles with the thri-kreen andcentaursof the plains, before they learned to live in peace.[22] In the mid-to-late 14thcenturyDR, one of the People of the Celestial Mantis, namedTiktikik, was discovered by a group of adventurers traveling in thephlogiston. The mantis warrior's body had been preserved for some forty centuries in the flow. Tiktikik desired to be returned to his own people, and his request was granted.[8]Tiktikik, after discovering a lost apocrypha of his people entitledLyric of the Eternal Lotus, came to believe himself to be his people's new holy leader. Within only four months, Tiktikik had convinced the spacefaring thri-kreen tribes to unite under his leadership and once again spread their rediscovered religion towildspace.[23] Tiktikik's fleet surrounded theRock of Braland demanded its conversion to the faith of the Mantis God of the Eternal Lotus, prompting even PrinceAndruto abandon his palace. Ultimately, the Rock was saved by the diplomatic actions of the same group of adventurers who had earlier rescued Tiktikik, as they happened to be on the Rock at the time when the thri-kreen flotilla arrived. The group showed Tiktikik a more ancient manuscript of theLyric of the Eternal Lotus, convincing him that the later edition had had additions from later editors who were not inspired.[23]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Charming and pleasant, Titivilus was an archdevil who had so mastered the art of negotiation that his victims could end up believing him their friend.[11][3] Like a contract lawyer, Titivilus always looked for any and all interpretations or loopholes in things said or sworn. And like a politician, he rarely gave definite answers or had a clear stance, yet always appeared to through the tactical use of words and phrases that left ambiguity or deniability.

Afterwards, they charged and surrounded their target, engaging in fierce melee combat. In addition to using a maca, they used their sharp claws and strong tail to knock opponents off their feet. The stinger at the end of their tails delivered a fatal venom.[6]Additionally, their bony armor was covered in poison.[2] Another favored tactic was to engage an enemy from below (or if fighting underground, occasionally from above).

They were a constantly warring race, convinced the world was full of creatures seeking to kill them, a self-fulfilling prophecy caused by their constant raiding. Their failure to plan for the future led them to conduct regular raids on nearby settlements. They were rejected by most races for their savagery, stench, and relative stupidity, and so took comfort in their isolation from other races and in destroying other sentient beings.

This was regardless of gender. However, weakness of any kind from their leaders was grounds for mutiny. Troglodyte society was clan-based, and the rank system was loose and in a constant state of flux.[2]Because they were once a servitor race, troglodytes would submit to the most powerful entity wishing to rule them, although this was usually other troglodytes.[2] Incapable both physically and mentally of crafting anything beyond stone tools and lacking in trade goods, troglodytes placed heavy value on metal items, seeing them as a sign of combat prowess. Having one was a serious status symbol and tribes could be torn apart, either socially or physically, on who may possess them.[2]If two tribes went to war, the result would either be the annihilation of one, or the merging of the broken halves, with the strongest living troglodyte taking over. Some troglodytes were so feral that they could not be controlled and would need to be kept locked away to prevent them from attacking others.[10] Young troglodytes were raised by the whole tribe rather than by their specific parents and were actively encouraged to fight each other at a young age. They could wield weapons by the time they were two years old and they were given steel weapons in order to go with hunters when they became older. Half of the population of a clan was female, and half of the males were hatchlings. Old troglodytes were presumed to have gathered wisdom over the years because they'd survived so long, with elders working as chief advisers. Very few members of a tribe were not warriors, besides dedicated hunter-gatherers andclerics.[2] Troglodyte lairs were either huge caverns or smaller caverns naturally connected by tunnels. Most troglodytes did not consider specific parts of the lair their living quarters and would fall asleep in random places. Half-eaten food and greasy secretions could be found lying everywhere in the lair, alongside whatever treasures the troglodytes stole during raiding. Lairs were chosen partially based on their proximity to nearby settlements, and also by their drafts. Lairs with a draft towards the inside of the cave allowed the scent of humans to be more easily detected and for the alarmed scents of other troglodytes to be picked up at farther distances.[9]Some troglodytes would tamedrakeswhile others employedmonitor lizardsin order to guard their warrens. They would mark the borders of their territory with pictographs made with blood anddungor the remains of various creatures to indicate their presence to beings without a proper sense of smell.[2]","Like chameleons, troglodytes could blend into their surroundings, allowing them to sneak up on unsuspecting prey. Most notable of their abilities was their overwhelming stench. A buildup of olfactory screams, battle cries, and various other messages would combine to forge an overpowering scent. So keen was a troglodyte's sense of smell that they were capable of smelling fear, or rather, the hormones given off by creatures experiencing fear, and would target those who they could smell were most afraid.[9]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Troglodytes were created by the sarrukh ofMhairshaulkto scout a part of theUnderdarkknown as theSerpent Deeps. The discovery of races like theabolethsandillithidsresulted in their use as sentries for a time, and attempted invasions by these forces failed because of the troglodyte's vigilance and the enemies' inability to cooperate.[8][13] They spread and settled throughout the Underdark at some point after the fall of the Mhairshaulk empire. They were eventually found by theyuan-ti(although some reports claimed the illithids were responsible) who bred those they found into the more powerful, but less intelligent,tren. After failing to defend Serpentes, the yuan-ti traded many tren to other races who almost immediately released them because of their overpowering odor. After this, many tren found their way back into the arms of the troglodyte race.[8] As skirmishes between their tribes were common, and troglodytes had trouble planning for the future, they rarely posed a threat in the Underdark and were more seen as a nuisance for when they staged raids to acquire food.[2]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"
"troll","A typical adult troll stood around 9 feet  (2.7 meters) tall on long, ungainly legs.[7]Some trolls grew even larger and these were referred to by some asfell trolls[2](not to be confused with thetwo-headed trolls with the same name). Their deceptively thin bodies had thick, rubbery hides colored in shades of mossy green or putrid greys, and possessed long hanging arms that ended in massive claws. The skull of a troll had a messy, hair-like growth colored black or steel grey.[7]Females were typically larger, and more powerful, than males.[8] Although they walked upright, trolls possessed a severe hunch, which caused the backs of their hands to drag on the ground. When they ran, their arms dangled still. Despite their awkward physical appearance, trolls were surprisingly agile and were well adapted to be masterful climbers.[8]","5eR5e4e3e2e1eTroll5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[1]SizeLargeTypeGiantAlignmentChaotic evilChallenge rating54th Edition Statistics[2]SizeStandardLargeFellHugeOriginNaturalTypeHumanoidAlignmentChaotic evil3rd Edition Statistics[3]SizeLargeTypeGiantAlignmentUsuallychaotic evilChallenge rating52nd Edition Statistics[4]SizeLargeAlignmentChaotic evil1st Edition Statistics[5]SizeLargeAlignmentChaotic evilGeneral InformationVisionDarkvision,[1]Low-light vision[3]Language(s)Giant,[1][3]Trollspeak[4]Favored climateCold[3]Favored terrainMountains[3]AppearanceAverage height9 ft  (2.7 m)[3]Average weight500 lb  (230 kg)[3]Skin color(s)Moss green, putrid gray, or mottled gray and green[3]Hair color(s)Iron gray, or greenish-black[3]HistoryFirst appearanceMonster Manual1steditionBased onTroll(Norse and Scandinavian)Trolls, also called theSpawn ofVaprakor theUndying Ones,[6]were a ravenous, predatory species of gianthumanoidfound throughout almost all the regions and types of climates inFaerûn,[7]from arctic wastes to tropical jungles,[8]and came in several sub-species.

They possessed poor hearing and a sensitivity to light, but superior olfactory senses.[8] A troll showing off its regenerative powers. Perhaps the most well-known factoid of trolls was their infamous regeneration. Whether a slash in its rubbery hide, or a dismembered limb, trolls could rapidly heal through most wounds. Onlyacidor fire could arrest the regeneration properties within a troll's flesh.[1]Dismembered limbs would continue to attack at opponents even after being severed.[8] Because of the regenerative properties of troll blood, it was extremely valuable. The blood that could be extracted from one troll was worth upwards of 400gp. This green viscous liquid was used in the manufacture of poisons, antidotes and certainpotions of healing.[8] Due to the adaptive nature of their physiology, trolls were especially susceptible to mutation. Although it was uncommon, actions taken throughout a troll's life could result in a physical or behavioral change, within the same generation.[1] When in heat, trolls exuded what was called ""mate-rut"" a foul-smelling to other species odor that signaled other trolls they were ready to breed.

The unique nature of the altered tadpole was not apparent until it underwent the process ofceremorphosis, where the usual procedures of morphological alteration to the host body were altered and the resulting mind flayer displayed a pair of unusually long mouth tentacles not seen in other illithids.[2] Ulitharids also exhibited psychological changes in addition to the physical, demonstrating a harsher, more spiteful temperament than other mind flayers.[2]Ulitharids were also quite rare within mind flayer enclaves: between 1-in-25 and 1-in-100 illithid tadpoles would develop into an ulitharid.[3][2] According toVolothamp Geddarm, ulitharids were also key to the expansion of illithid society, as they are the caste of mind flayers capable of eventually metamorphosing intoelder brains; an ulitharid that grew sick of fighting its parent elder brain for power would take a substantial part of the colony to a new area, whereupon its brain would be placed in a new or reclaimed brain pool and be merged with the brains of other illithids to become a larval elder brain, capable of supporting illithid larva and expanding their empire. The only restriction on this process was that the ulitharid could not die of old age, as their brains would be too decrepit for the process. To that end, an ulitharid often carried an extractor staff, a device that would allow it to remove its own brain when the brain pool was ready, which would also recycle its body into psionically-active sludge that would assist the new elder brain in adapting to its pool, and could serve as a useful melee weapon in a fight.","5e3e2eVarious depictions of ulitharids.Ulitharid5e3e2e5th Edition Statistics[1]SizeLargeTypeAberrationAlignmentLawful evilChallenge rating93rd Edition Statistics[2]SizeLargeTypeAberrationAlignmentUsuallyLawful evilChallenge rating122nd Edition Statistics[3]SizeLargeAlignmentLawful evilGeneral InformationPatron deityIlsensineVisionDarkvision[1]Activity cycleAny[3]DietCarnivoreAverage lifespan250 years[3]Language(s)Deep Speech,Undercommon,Telepathy[1]Favored terrainUnderground[3]AppearanceAverage height7.5‒9 ft (2.3‒2.7 m)[3][2]Skin color(s)Dark mauve[3][2]Eye color(s)Silver-white[2]HistoryFirst appearanceDungeon24The nobles ofillithidsociety,[4]ulitharids(loosely meaning ""enlightened ones"",[5]or ""noble devourers"" inUndercommon[6]) possessed extraordinary gifts of strength, and a vile, malicious intellect.

In addition, their powerful arms and legs both ended in tough claws, able to rip through rock with ease. Rather than a nose, they had a series of gill-like openings in their almost non-existent necks, potentially due to aquatic origins.[8]Owing to their wide and heavy bodies, they couldn't properly maneuver in open spaces and ended up lumbering around when not traversing their tunnels.[7]As indicated by their name, their hides were mostly black, although their front was usually burnt brown or yellowish gray.[8]","5e4e3e2e1eVarious depictions of umber hulks.Umber Hulk5e4e3e2e1e5th Edition Statistics[1]SizeLargeTypeMonstrosityAlignmentChaotic evilChallenge rating54th Edition Statistics[2]SizeLargeOriginNaturalTypeMagical beastAlignmentUnaligned3rd Edition Statistics[3]SizeStandardLargeTruly horridHugeTypeAberrationAlignmentUsuallychaotic evilChallenge ratingStandard7Truly horrid142nd Edition Statistics[4]AlignmentChaotic evil1st Edition Statistics[5]AlignmentChaotic evilGeneral InformationMovementBurrowing[3]VisionDarkvision[3]Language(s)Umber Hulk[1]Favored terrainUnderground[3]HistoryFirst appearanceMonster Manual1steditionUmber hulkswere four-eyed monstrosities who lived deep under the earth. Their massive claws tunneled through rock with ease and their thick armor was as strong asfull plate.[1]","Umber hulks were commonly viewed by other races as unthinking brutes. This was a misconception they were perfectly happy to propagate. Whilst not particularly intelligent, umber hulks were perfectly capable of rational thought and forward planning. Umber hulks normally had no need for complex plans,magic, numbers, or technology to accomplish their goals and so did not employ such things. If a situation warranted more than sheer force, they were intelligent enough to use their earth-shaping abilities to out-think an enemy.[8] Umber hulks were solitary, not due to a hatred of one another but simply because working together had no perceivable benefit, as they could handle most threats individually. They preferred to stay underground, as there was no use in going above ground, and they disliked the light.[8]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Umber hulks fought only when hunting, and did so for the express purpose of gaining some material benefits. Mostly, an umber hulk was driven by a need for food and would target foes that it perceived as obviously weaker than itself.[8]They conducted raids on dungeons and settlements, but would only kill a few before leaving, so as to give the food source time to replenish. Using their feelers, they could sense movement around them and they would lie in wait around corridors and other crucial points waiting to strike. They might also create small holes so as to properly size up their options and pick the weakest target.[7] Typically, after an ambush was sprung, an umber hulk would utilize its confusing gaze.[1]If the combination of ambush, power, and confusion failed to be enough, they would utilize a variety of tactics to escape, retreat, or recollect itself. They could cause cave-ins, lead enemies into dead ends, create circular paths, initiate floods, collapse tunnels they enter and exit, or create pitfalltraps.[7][8]","NOT FOUND","Umber hulks were primarily solitary creatures and it was unknown if they had anything akin to a society of their own.

Although they were mostly solitary, some lived in clusters (groups of 2–4) typically comprising mothers and their young. They typically destroyed items they couldn't use, such as clothes and weapons, but curiosities that caught their eyes would be hidden within their lairs along with food items, hidden and guarded with simple earth-related traps. Their lairs were large caverns with the walls covered in claw marks, possibly due to claw sharpening, or from the fact the umber hulk made the cavern.[8]","Nearby beings that made eye contact with the umber hulk's smaller eyes would have their mind scrambled, causing them to wander in random directions, lash out at those nearby, or simply stand dazed and confused.[1]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Umber hulks were once reported to be magically created mutants, whose creators had long since been lost to history.[12] However, according to early writings, umber hulks were among the oldest creatures in the cosmos, having been around since before theDawn War.

Love was flipped to obsession, and the feelings of friendship were made into feelings of jealousy. Many vampires became obsessed and fixated on things they desired in the past – those who once sought love became predators searching for beauty in their victims, and those who valued youth could fixate on children, snuffing out the future potential of mortals at the very beginning of their journeys. These obsessions extended to possessions, as many vampires delved into collecting art, acquiring terrifying implements of torture, or decorating their lairs with trophies.[4][1] Being highly intelligent and ageless creatures, vampires forged their plans meticulously and advanced the schemes slowly, sometimes taking decades to take steps toward their goals.

The preparation for the ritual took two centuries. Cazador's favored vampire spawn, the number that includedAstarion Ancunín, a member of theAbsolute Adversaries, collected countless victims for their master, turning them all into spawn who were to be sacrificed to empower the vampire at the center of the ritual. During theAbsolute crisis, the ritual was initiated. However, neither its outcome or Cazador's fate were recorded.[11]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"
"vampire spawn","For the most part, a vampire retained the appearance they had in life. The main differences were their pale skin tone and sharp, feral features, giving them a predatory aspect. Whatever their eye color was in life, after transformation, vampires' eyes changed to a red color that was hard to forget. Their hands ended in sharp, glassy claws.[5][6]Notably, vampires possessed retractable sharp monstrous canines used to pierce the victims' flesh.[5]When vampires were well-fed, their undead bodies' decomposition halted and was reversed. A recently-fed vampire had a more pinkish skin color, staving pale complexion and kick-starting the circulatory system temporarily. Sometimes, vampires conceal their undead nature by wearing blush andmakeup. They did not cast shadows, had no reflections inmirrors, and moved in complete silence.

However, this regeneration could be canceled by extreme heat, cold, or rotting. Their skin easily blended into terrain surrounded by plant life, and their eyes could see easily in darkness. Due to their primitive, plant-like brains, they showed some resistance to enchantment.[1][2]The tendrils that sprouted from vegepygmies' bodies granted them additional senses, allowing them to ""taste"" the air and to feel for vibrations in it.[5] As vegepygmies aged, spore clusters collected on their bodies, and their skin grew tougher and harder to damage. They could disperse clouds of spores that acted as russet mold spores, infecting non-plants who breathed them in, and possibly killing them, causing them to give rise to more vegepygmies.[1] Thornies were stronger and tougher, if less intelligent than vegepygmies.

Forest vegepygmies were more aggressive and predominately hunters, while underground vegepygmies were vegetarians, preferring to scavenge, and more likely to ally with other plant-based races.

They saw no reason to accept a bargain when they could simply kill the diplomat, take his treasure, and then have the added benefit of sating their need for carnage and having a fresh meal.[1]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Vrocks were the terrors of the Abyssal skies,[8]dangerous fiends that pranced merrily through the air, gleefully ripping apart their quarry with beak and claw.

Despite their build and abilities being more suited to mobile combat, their deep need for carnage and general idiocy threw them deep into the heart of melee.[4][3][8]This single-minded and insatiable desire for combat could be actively used in their enemy's favor. In their reckless pursuit of conflict, a vrock could be lured away from its group by seemingly vulnerable victims only to be lured into an ambush where they were outnumbered and outmatched, blasted from the safety of cover by hidden foes.[8] There were multiple proposed reasons why vrocks did not use their devastating Dance of Ruin ability more often. It was thought that the dance could potentially harm the vrocks as well as any others within the vicinity, although this was a contested belief. Others traced it to the vrocks own unwillingness to cooperate, love for carnage and general stupidity. If another vrock was in danger it was all the more treasure for the others to take, and so it was only done if they were all mutually threatened. The dance also took a considerable amount of time to perform and being stopped in any way, either from pain or other restraints, would force them to start over.[3][4] Despite their many flaws, vrocks were intelligent enough to employ effective group tactics, making them more dangerous than other demonic brutes.[8]Once they started cooperating, a flock of vrocks was capable of being an elite fighting force with coordinated attacks of such perfect timing that evendevilswould have to take notice.[13][4]","NOT FOUND","A pair of vrocks being led into battle by a more powerful tanar'ri. A gathering of vrocks was known as a ""murder"", and the size of the group could vary wildly. Typically they moved in groups of under eight members, but they were known to organize into squadrons of ten and perhaps greater numbers in times of war.[13][3][4] Vrocks were employed as guards, elite assault troops, infiltrators, and covert operatives due to their quality skills in these tasks. This was despite the fact that they were known to scheme against their superiors, as they were not so intellectual as to be likely to succeed.[8][4]They were still carefully watched for disloyalty however, as they were likely to switch sides without any notice.[2] Although they made excellent bodyguards and enforcers for stronger and smarter demons, vrocks truly came into their own during massed battles as aerial strike teams. They flew above enemy forces with various debris in tow, raining rocks and the like down upon their foes before plunging into the fray.[8]","A strange set of supernatural abilities aided the vrocks in their violent endeavors.

From that point, they would grow into thick vine-like structures for a short time and poison the victim, eating away at their skin. Poison diminishing magic or the sprinkling ofholy watercould stop their effects. If allowed to run its course, assuming the victim survived that long, they stopped causing pain after a few minutes at most, and would wither away in a few days.[8][4] However, the most dreadful ability of the vrocks was their Dance of Ruin. When enough vrocks of a certain combined strength gathered together, generally between 3-5, they could begin a dangerous rite through wild dancing and chanting in an ancient language.

He took great pleasure in inflicting terror and sorrow before his victims' deaths, destroying treasured possessions and crushing their hopes. He despised civilization and if he were to conquer other realms,abyssalor otherwise, he would not attempt to rebuild their former structures.[9][2] To the Beast of Butchery, the gnolls were both his instruments and children, whom he sought to use to bring his ideal world to fruition. Such a world would be one of endless combat and brutality, where gnolls ruled supreme and all other creatures would be either slaves or food. Ultimately when the mortal world possessed one final champion he would challenge them to battle, slay them, and preside victoriously in his version of paradise; a wasteland of decaying corpses, in an absolutely ruined world.[9][2] Despite his savage nature, Yeenoghu was not stupid, being capable of subtlety and trickery, but merely choosing not to use it in most circumstances.[1]He actively encouraged the arrival of new races into his followers, recognizing the lack of his people's unity.

This, the 422nd layer of the Abyss, was covered in barren hills, great ravines, wide savannas with poisonous and parasite-filled waters, and sickly yellow forests. It served as his own personal hunting grounds, where he played with mortals in cruel hunting games. There were nearly no structures in his realm, it being entirely devoid of civilization.[2] Six miles from Yeenoghu's lair all predators became wasteful and savage, killing far more than required and leaving it to rot in careless displays of wastefulness. Within a mile of Yeenoghu's personal lair was a dangerous region influenced by his dark powers. Iron spikes grew out from the ground and stone, which Yeenoghu used to impale his victims, and intelligent beings that spent an hour within this region might grow increasingly deranged. The longer sentient beings remained in this region the more gnoll-like they became with mental changes including increased rage, aching blood-lust, hatred of civilization, the need to collect trophies from bodies, and a fondness for the flesh of intelligent beings.[2] Within the smoke-filled halls of his lair he sat upon a throne of dismembered limbs of those who'd angered him. His lair was populated with gnolls, hyenas, andghouls.[2]It was a place of blood and death from which he could exert a certain level of control. He could cause iron spikes to rise from the ground and impale those underneath them, as well as fill gnolls and hyenas with a bloodthirsty rage.[2]The lair itself was a giant mobile fortress-city, pulled by legions of slaves and demonic creatures on hundreds of stone wheels.[4]If Yeenoghu was to perish, the effects of his power on the local region would eventually fade in less than ten days.[2] Yeenoghu once took over the layer above his own, known by most as the White Kingdom. After conquering it, however, he did not possess the resources required to hold dominion over it, forcing him to retreat back to his home layer. Despite leaving it, he still technically ruled it through his vassal Doresain, the King of Ghouls.[2]","The Gnoll Lord spent most of his time either guiding his gnoll children to victory through his mysterious omens, tormenting and hunting lesser demons and mortals for his amusement, and plotting against upcoming abyssal powers to prevent them from gaining influence.

Sadly, a yochlol's friendship or even love often led to their loved ones being persecuted by those who disliked the yochlol.[4] The exact nature of the kinship was not properly understood due to the strange backwards nature of their relations. Yochlols had a tendency to abandon partners whose acquaintances weren't bothered by their presence, yet the persecution of these companions caused yochlols to furiously vent their anger on the perpetrators; however, they did not mourn the death of their partners. Some theorized that yochlol enjoyed the downfall of these individuals under their relationship but yochlol never betrayed their lovers and raged when they died.[4] Unlike other demons yochlols did not have rivalries amongst themselves, for they did not view each other as competition; indeed, handmaidens readily and eagerly cooperated with each other under the common goal of serving Lolth. Unless Lolth's enemies were present, yochlols did not engage in killing sprees or frenzies of mindless violence. Ironically, despite their ability to get along with their own kind and even other mortals, they were contemptuous of other demons, rarely associating with them, and, rare among demons, cared little about the state of theBlood War, but only for their mistress.[10][7]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","The yochlol's prowess in shapechanging gave them a great variety of versatility in matters of combat.[4]Yochlol in their natural forms slammed away at their foes with their numerous tentacles, the noxious gas forcing opponents to either stay away or find some other means to attack it. Yochlol were more likely, however, to be found in their humanoid form since it was capable of using weapons, thus granting them greater tactical flexibility, and they'd typically only abandon that form when they knew someone was nearby to pick up their armor and weapons. Drow form allowed them to more easily convince other beings to cooperate using their psionic abilities, as they would more readily trust this form as opposed to that of a melting monstrosity.[4][1] Most yochlol trained to enhance their abilities, sometimes aspriestsandsorcerers[4][1](though not aswizardssince Lolth discouraged the practice)[11]but most often asbards. Bards were often welcome in the halls of nobility, furthering the yochlol's infiltration ability.[4][1] Fighting alone was rarely their plan, as their mental manipulation abilities gave them access to servants to protect them. They prioritized their mission objective above their own lives, and would make whatever sacrifice necessary to complete it. Their second greatest priority laid somewhere between themselves, other yochlol, and any other beings they had befriended.[4]Despite these prerogatives, they still relished battle and often hissed, whispered, screamed, or even told their names in combat to make any potential escapee ​​​​​fear its return.​​[6] Two of the yochlol's forms.","NOT FOUND","Yochlols were most numerous in their abyssal layer of origin, theDemonweb Pits. Within it they commonly served as Lolth's enforcers, scouts, and appropriately as handmaidens. When on other layers of the Abyss they were normally in disguise performing espionage on other demonic powers. Because most demons, including demon lords likeDemogorgonandGraz'zt, knew that yochlol exclusively worked for Lolth they normally gave them a wide berth. The Spider Queen's minions were only interfered with rarely, as yochlol were one of the few demons with near universal close relations to their master, allowed to roam the layers of the Abyss uninhibited. Lolth's reputation of giving great rewards to her most effective servants certainly applied to yochlols, and greater versions of their race did exist.[4][10] Only high priestesses of the Queen of Spiders were told how to summon a yochlol to thePrime Material Plane. They were only supposed to be called upon in dire need or to witness sacrifices in the name of their dark goddess.​[12]This was when they were not infiltrating drow civilizations, whether in the open or in secret.[1]Lolth used yochlols to spy on the drow and ensure they were worshiping her properly.​[12]They also worked under drow matrons either as assassins, advisors, or even lovers in some cases. Yochlols were also used as a channel of communication to and from the Abyss.[3]Some of Lolth's most faithful believed they would be reincarnated into yochlol if they devoted themselves completely to her.[13]When summoned by anyone that wasn't a high priestess or above they faithfully served their caller for one task, as decreed by Lolth, before attempting to escape to the Material Plane whether or not it was agreed upon. It was at these points when they infiltrated non-drow societies and plotting cunning schemes to turn their residents evil.[7]","A yochlol's transformation. The abilities of a yochlol were dependent on their current state, but some were consistent throughout their various forms. Within seconds they could transform from their current form to any of their others. At all times yochlol were protected from having their minds read by an effect similar tomind blank, both hiding their thoughts and true alignment. A slew of magical andpsionicabilities made yochlol even more dangerous than they already were. Charming and domination magic, as well as the ability to read minds, made it incredibly difficult to socially outgun them. In all their corporeal forms, they were somewhat spider-like, able to create webs, navigate them, and climb on walls. If in particular danger, there was half a chance they could call a second yochlol for aid to escape the threat. With the favor of Lolth, yochlol had a minor divine protection from harm, making them even more difficult to injure.[4][1]They reverted to their waxy selves upon death, thus revealing the nature of their being.[4][1] Their repertoire of psionic powers included all manner of psionic defense modes,[10]particularlymental barrier[8]andmind blank,[3][8]as well as the psionic attack modesego whip,id insinuation,[8][10]andmind thrust. The other psionic powers possible of them were primarily of thetelepathydiscipline.[10]These includedaura alteration,cell adjustment(though only usable in their humanoid form),[3][8]contact,[10]detect thoughts,[3]domination,[8][10]ESP,invisibility,mindlink,phobia amplification,probe,[10]probability travel,[8]andpsychic impersonation.[10] In either humanoid or true form a yochlol's touch was as venomous as that of a spider's fangs.[4][1]Within their arachnid forms their true fangs were laid bare and it was far easier for them to use their more spider-like powers. This was often the form they used when traversing webs and attempting to poison their opponents. While in the form of a toxic mist however yochlol were capable of flight, and slipping through any airtight space. They could fly near living beings and force them to breathe their noxious forms in, causing them illness. They could not be harmed in this state by non-magical weapons that simply passed right through them.[4][1]This was also the only form in which they could contact their home plane in for further advice.[3]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","A yochlol in its full grotesque glory.

In order to defeat the creature,Wulfgarcollapsed the cavern ceiling upon the yochlol and himself.

She was originally anangelof theSeven Heavensbefore transforming into anarchdeviland falling to theNine Hells.[5][8]","Zariel was a warmonger obsessed with battle, someone who lived to fight and judged others on their combat skills and willingness to use them. She prized zealous fury as much as discipline and training, and led her troops into battle herself with iron resolve, leaving many a structure in ruin as she carved her war path. However, neither her own battle prowess nor that of her forces could disguise the fact that Zariel was reckless and rash, relying on her troops' berserker rage and her own determination to win her fights.[5] Her behavior had warped to match that of her infernal peers, for she had become a cruel being that inflicted psychological torment on her enemies and subjected those that displeased her to horrible fates.[4][9]She had also grown distrusting to the point of being taken aback by a heroic act of self-sacrifice, having become the kind of plotter to set numerous schemes in motion at once and deal in contracts to bind people into servitude.[14]While once a purveyor of blind justice,[10]Zariel had allowed her emotions to color her decisions, twisting it into rage-fueled vengeance, and she refused to forgive even decades after being wronged.[12][4][14]","Zariel flying across the wastelands of Avernus, reaching for her sword. Originally, the layer of Avernus was a beautiful domain, a bustling paradise filled with lush gardens, rural countryside, trade outposts, cities, and other grand locales. It had been so crafted by Asmodeus with the goal of tempting mortals. But as a result of the constantdemonicinvasions coming through the Styx and the continuous carnage of theBlood War, the pristine land was ruined, leaving behind only remnants of its former beauty such as ruins, mirages, pleasant sensory illusions without source, and ancient relics that caused fleeting moments of pure joy.[17][5][27] During Zariel's rule, Avernus was a domain of ruin, a war-torn wasteland covered in layers of bones, collapsed structures, and enormous, broken war machines as far as the eye could see.[17]The rocky terrain was marked by rivers of blood, piles of corpses, and groaningnupperibohordes that covered the landscape like living lakes as they trawled in search of food.[17][9]Other natural hazards included bubblingtar pits,quicksand, lava lakes, andsaltflats made from the mass tears of the damned.[17]Food and drink from Avernus was tainted if not inedible, and even if brought from another source it tasted ashy or spoiled. The rarity of good food encouraged mortal inhabitants to hoard it, and the plane itself supernaturally rewarded selfish behavior.[27] Avernus's sky was filled by an ambient, blood-red light that seemed to come from nine suns just below the horizon, with no visible celestial bodies in the sky. The light filtered through the nightmarish clouds that obscured the sky, and the constant twilight made it difficult to track the passage of time.[17][28]A particularly dangerous phenomenon was the seemingly random, motion-trackingfireballsthat rained from the sky and left smoking craters in their wake.[9][15] The air smelled ofbrimstoneand burning tar and was often blasted by shrieking gusts of hot wind that occasionally stirred darksandstormscapable of tearing flesh from bone. The air was populated by biting flies,hellwasps, andstirges,[17]which were known to flock onCoward's Way, feasting on the blood of Zariel'sHellriderbetrayers as they hung crucified on metal trees.[29]","Prosecuting the Blood War took up much of Zariel's time and attention, and she had little room to deal with anything else.[30]Her offensive military campaign often had her at the forefront of invasions when she wasn't within a flying fortress overseeing Avernus's defense.[5][26]She apparently had a penchant for spawning cambions to serve as leaders for her followers.[31] It was also her responsibility to ensure the defense of the plane against outside attack, the River Styx being a particularly important area for demonic entry and infernal strikes against the Abyss.Styx devilsguarded the citadels and outposts overlooking the river, but it fell to Zariel to manage travel to and from Avernus, and she had the final say over who could pass through.[4][25]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","Zariel taking on Yeenoghu's balor. Together withGeryon, Zariel was among the archdevils best known for their unmatched martial prowess.[21]Such was her power that she could best abalorin one-on-one combat and only needed a few seconds afterwards to collect herself.[14] Following her fall, she was enhanced with fiendish powers, such as the typical archdevil ability toalter her form. In addition, many of her powers gained a distinct fire motif: she could createfireballsandwalls of fireat will, her weapons seared with hellish flame, and her magical stare could cause spontaneous combustion.[4]Whereas typical solars had the ability to castresurrectionthree times a day and could remove ailments such as disease,poison, blindness, or deafness with only a touch,[22]Zariel had instead the power to castfinger of deaththree times per day and was endowed with a horrid, poisoning touch that inflicted the same conditions that an angelic healing touch would reverse.[4] Zariel's fall had also come with undeniable drawbacks.

Originally, Zariel was a solar under the command of the Morning LordLathander,[3]her name, according toReya Mantlemorn, meaning ""Companion of Light"".[48]From the Seven Heavens of MountCelestia, Zariel was tasked with tracking the progress of the Blood War in Avernus, but from continued exposure to the conflict, she developed an obsession with the War and a taste for battle. Zariel was impetuous in nature, and couldn't ignore the desire to fight within her, but her requests were consistently blocked by her angelic peers.[5][12] Zariel believed that it was the responsibility of the angelic host to defeat evil, and was of the opinion that an assault from the hosts of Celestia could wipe out both sides of the Blood War in one stroke, freeing themultiversefrom the fiends who destroyed each other and vast chunks of it in the process. Despite chastising her superiors for their stance as neutral observers, Zariel was repeatedly forbidden from entering the conflict. Zariel was frustrated by her their refusal to engage in the war,[5][12]and drew the line when Yeenoghu slaughtered a village under her protection.[3] Zariel swoops down to end the slaughter of the Gnoll Lord. Late in theYear of the Bow, 1354 DR,[49]Zariel defied her superiors and led theHellridersofElturel, a host of personally trained mortal allies, into Avernus, in the battle that became known asthe Ride. Outnumbered by the devils, the army was defeated and the survivors fled in terror and shame. Asmodeus sent a delegation ofosyluthsto retrieve her unconscious body from underneath a mountain of the dead, whereupon the Lord of the Nine allowed her to recover and congratulated her. Zariel succumbed to the corrupting nature of Hell and Asmodeus made her an archdevil and dubbed her his champion.[5][4][12][note 1][note 2] At some point during her rule, she had the demonym for Avernus changed from ""Avernan"" to ""Avernal"", to the mild confusion of the Hell's denizens.[50]","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUND","NOT FOUNDNOT FOUND"

Befitting her nature as the Lady of Decay, she took glee in the slow rot of her foes from the inside out, being patient and subtle compared to her peers and delighted by the slow transformation of enemies into allies. She was desperate to avoid any setbacks in her quest for power and would go so far as to beg for mercy and offer to serve obviously more powerful foes, immediately and inevitably attempting to turn such a situation to her advantage and secretly wither the bonds of her opposition.[3]","Zuggtmoy's lair was inShedaklah, a massive palace of two dozen mushrooms, all interconnected with bridges and lined with countless chambers and tunnels.
